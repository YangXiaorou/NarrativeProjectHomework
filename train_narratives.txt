This is Los Angeles and it's the height of summer in a small bungalow off La Sienaqa Clara serves homemade chilean chips and red plastic bowls wine and blue plastic The colors don't match and the cups are too big to serve wine You didn't get half the things on my list she hisses at Gary as he passes He shrugs No one seems to mind but her Did you have to buy a 400 bottle scotch Gary waves away her upset He seems distracted guilty of something She can tell by the way he avoids her Clara looks at her face in the hallway mirror She's 33 years old She's slowly getting white hairs in her eyebrows She feels completely alone Grad students fill the low ceiling space chewing big words gesticulating emphatically Gary's face looks up from the photo his parents have framed expensive mahogany He laid it graduating capping down and all Toast more toast to our doctor philosophy amazing art prodigy to Gary Loisin Clara's carefully picked happy graduation vapor banners hanging too low from the Adobe doors People have to duck when they go in the kitchen 74th in Columbus apartment 9D Stephen Purdue watches his wife get ready for her violin lesson Black clothes pearl necklace Her controlled quiet elegance We cannot ignore this We should be vigilant Stephen Married eight years he still can't believe his good luck Stephen are you listening Yes yes he is listening Sasha broke up with now a missing ten sleeping pills Oh God what is his daughter getting into again We don't want repeat last year There is an edge in Margaret's voice This girl better grow up She sounds cold and he notices Margaret pauses by the mirror then touches her neck She hates her age She hates being Sasha's stepmother You think I should talk to her Maggie Margaret turns and wraps her arms around Stephen's stoop frame He looks much older than 50 She doesn't talk to me Margaret whisper So yes I think you should do it She stops I'll be home late tonight she adds She wants Stephen to ask why but he doesn't The graduation party keeps going Clara stares at her husband once the most handsome man in the room 35 and already balding His face is liquor flushed as he bends over a four month old baby boy Son of friends His friends not hers He asks to hold the boy and eyes melt In an alternate universe this boy would be theirs Gary's awkward The baby starts crying and everyone laughs You're not daddy material man Clara can see the back of Gary's neck all red embarrassed but hiding it She knows this neck has studied it each night for ten years And Clara is suddenly filled with need to protect him She puts her hand on small of his back hoping he'd turn The baby's father steps up So is time to open that scotch Clara you're moving to New York too Going where Doing what Clara looks at Gary confused he smiles past her to the crowd He's basking in the glory of something Tommy the baby's father looks at face and takes a step back Oh man did I blow this surprise I'm so sorry You guys are into bullshit drama again I just like to sleep deeply these days that's all Sasha strides up to her dad and opens her palm The ten white sleeping pills stare at him an act of defiance I certainly don't need you guys freaking out Sasha watches her dad flush the pills down the toilet He should have put them back in the pill box Of course Sasha's right and now his gesture of closure feels stupid He puts his hand on her shoulder but she wiggles away So how do you sleep these days dad He turns on CNN Have you told Margaret yet Stephen stairs at the TV and carnage You haven't told my stepmother you lost all your money that your stocks have all tanked Then I might have to drop out of college on the TV the Middle East India wars earthquakes crashes Steven's size There's no need to disturb Margaret I'll figure it out What do you want for your birthday he asks I want you to start telling the truth says Sasha her voice for the first time is breaking Your duplicity is so fucking exhausting Flara Stairs a Genie She must be what 25 26 So in love with this baby spitting up goo on her lap And then the moment they found out I was pregnant Tommy's parents swept in and all our debt all 10 in one check so we could start fresh and not stress Amazing just amazing I love them That's great Genie Clara Musters You want have kids ask Genie still pudgy from the birth so full of life good cheer Not yet Clara says stiffly can't afford it for one Genie looks up expecting more of an answer I really like modern installation art I don't really get it admits Genie Tommy says it's an incredible opportunity for Gary a chance to create his own side specific piece downtown in New York We'll see Clara says She hates for making her the killjoy She takes out more bottles of wine from the cupboard People pat her on the back You must be so proud of him Clara She doesn't care anymore how much wine she'll serve at least one bottle per person these days Inside the cab Margaret holds on to her violin case All the way down Columbus okay She gives the instructions in a pleasant stiff voice and pulls out her cell She cancels her violin lesson The cab driver's eyes keep checking her out She pauses hits voicemail Alexander's accent purrs in her ear He's waiting for her So what's eating you princess Ask the cab driver He's seek His turban blocks her view of the asphalt Whatever it is tell your husband Don't keep the stuff in That's what gives people cancer Alexander's name vibrates on her phone Margaret texts him instead I'm running a few minutes late The eyes of the cab driver is still there in the mirror Do you have children princess She shakes her head no without thinking and then she's terrified by what she's done denying Sasha's existence But it's too late to undo it You look like someone who should says the cab driver and is quiet the rest of the way She pays with 20 as they pull by the fountain and hates herself because as if to prove him right she overtips No art residences for us genie laughs nods of the gurgling boy on her lap Tommy in dangling his scotch by his crotch He holds a cracker piled with overripe brie and jelly shoves it in his wife's mouth She thankfully chews like a chipmunk His black faded t shirt walks towards the kitchen I'm an existentialist fatalist at boasts then he ducks The congratulations sign still hits him on the back One more Tommy please She's never losing the baby weight that way Clara thinks But who the fuck cares she's young Clara looks at the baby who's drooling over his hands and walks out of the room How could you do this to me Clara Gary When did you find out about New York When did you even apply Anger and humiliation are drowning her breath and probably a touch too much wine But Gary is giddy and thrilled and sees nothing wrong with their lives Baby be proud he laughs It's just for a year we'll work it out And what is so sad he really believes this Alexander Margaret walk down Broadway Margaret feels beautiful I quit my Wall Street job three months ago I'm taking violin lessons For fun she adds Alexander doesn't respond And Stephen took early retirement He did very well with investments She can hear the pride in her voice and she stops praising your private life to a lover even a former lover feels wrong But she's doing it Stephen's a therapist now Alexander laughs Alex banker who listens to people's pain for a hobby I thought she wanted a kid isn't that why you married She's quiet for a second Sasha's been a bit of a handful When she says it it feels lame She took a year off did some great journalism in West Africa But after she came back Alexander stops in front of a store front He's not paying attention Margaret braces herself Why did you call me She asks he turns smiles at her She's scared to say more And somehow she's also excited Margaret's phone vibrates in her purse She knows Stephen And she doesn't look I don't want to go back to New York Clarice as quietly The ditches from last night are still in the sink Gary has a meeting with advisors to discuss the internship Of course he's late And now the dishes won't be done until this evening Crusted chili soap bubbles scrub she's shopped and cooked and served and now dishes again I'll do them later Don't fuss Gary says as he flips over Tupperware newspapers looking You've seen my wallet How long is this internship Gary September to June Without getting paid I can't afford to float this whole place by myself Gary heads to the door I'm sure you can be a journalist in New York too But she just signed her contract here and he knows it We should have talked this move through before you applied He laughs You would have talked me out of it For a moment he looks like a boy getting caught and standing up into fcians almost charming but he's 35 What's good for me is also good for us That's certainly used to be true Is it now Alexander pays for their hot dogs with crumpled up dollar bills he pulls out of his pocket New York is the best I'm so glad to be back The last eight years have been good to him He still has a cat in his step My new apartment looks great Maggie he says you'll see I'll bet you want to move in Is this a come online She catches a glimpse of herself in a window suddenly aware she should have colored her hair New York is very glad you're back she says The hot dog mustard drips on her blouse Alexander clears it looks his finger and smiles His eyes land on hers as she for his words I need you to connect me with your former colleagues on Wall Street he says We're working on a major piece on international corruption its Pulitzer worthy Margaret is so aware of her aging neck that's why he called a little networking opportunity That's what this meeting is She touches her neck she wants to protect herself she wants to hide Alexander hands Margaret his card Have Sasha call me he says I'm looking for interns and she sounds like a catch Here is your lunch leftovers and blue Tupperware We're postponing our lives Gary What about getting a job Between looking for keys and slipping on flip flops sets the Tupperware on the mail table and forgets it She doesn't remind him the door closes she stares at it Next to the Tupperware she sees the envelope from American Express Gary's business account She takes his lunch and tosses it in the trash hold Tupperware then picks it out opens it tries it cold chili Her eyes find his wallet right by the couch 400 for scotch She shoves chili in her mouth without stopping Is New York worth the fight Every bit of being every bit of rise it's all comfort now and then it's all guilt Across town Gary sits at his art studio drawing photo prints moldy coffee cups He knows it's in him the it the something the drive He sits paralyzed under the light He's losing her he is losing his wife He looks his phone He should call Clara but he doesn't Margaret the apartment in a horrible mood She can hear a loud yelling from the back Stephen yells at a man o'clock at night what the hell The super is fighting with Stephen There's a horrible leak The ceiling Sasha's room is caved in The super is yelling no one told him about the damn leak Stephen's upset there might be asbestos Sasha seems weirdly amused Margaret walks away from this mess and into the living room Pours herself a large glass of red wine Sasha walks in with a mop Margaret turns glass in hand How could you not notice a huge leak right over your head Sasha just shrugs It's not my fault the building is old I'm serious Sasha How can you be so checked out Sasha's voice is anointingly calm I pick a fight with you Margaret You want to get drunk Just get drunk Her stepdaughter looks at her with cold eyes Where the hell you been You've got mustard stains all over your blouse We were trying to reach you When the phone rings Clara's throwing up She catches her breath Make sure to clean everything well Underneath toilet seat too always check that before she calls back It's her mom You want me to send you some money No mama We're good Gary got a job yet He should stayed designing those greeting cards He was good at that I still find them at Walmart The way her mom says that it could be ultimate praise or ultimate scorn That reminds Clara she has a card to send It's August 18th She still remembers the address by heart Ready for work Almost mama You'll hold on to that job A staff job is not easy to get I'm really proud of you baby You still want the name of that lawyer Mr the best He won't overcharge Clara closes her eyes That was one conversation in thousands but her mom won't forget I'm not ready to throw away the last years of my life The moment she snaps she regrets it Gary and I are sticking it out Stephen can hear their agitated voices full of anger He tries his best at brokering peace Can I get you guys water He calls to the back He stands in his pajamas by the light of the open fridge He can hear Margaret's voice rising high Sasha if you're in trouble you have to tell us Sasha storms in your wife off my back I'll handle it Maggie There's nothing handle your dad She's just fixating on me My boyfriend just ditched I'm upset I'm simply upset What's wrong with being upset You're the therapist No You tell me Is there something wrong if I'm upset She's yelling now Margaret stands by the door Upset is one thing she says Stealing pills is another I didn't steal your damn sleeping pills I am not my mother Okay I don't want Do you want me to sign a statement or something I am not my mother I'm not Stephen moves to hug Sasha Margaret steps back and exits the room She wants to go far away She takes her violin case puts it inside the closet and then she mocks the floor Next time you blink Clara you'll be throwing away the last 20 and then 25 years of your life Her mom's voice is flat steel I love you Mama says Clara When her father died Gary set next to her mother for days holding her hand He's better at grieving Ten years together The lawyer's name is John Zimler He's a great divorce lawyer I'll send you the number says her mother before she hangs up In Clara's closet there's huge stack of Gary's greeting cards meticulously drawn worlds within worlds creatures of the woods and of the seas flying flying She chooses one in shades of purple and green She writes Happy 21st birthday sweetie Oh God she tears up the card Picks up another Happy 21st birthday She replaces sweetie with a number of exclamation marks Exos too Neutral yet warm More exos She doesn't know what else to say Never expects a response But today she adds one more line Let me know how you are She regrets it Stephen comes home for lunch carrying a bunch of colorful foam tubes He uses them to help patients move through aggression We'll have a family session It will help us all loosen up Margaret rolls her eyes There are more pressing issues than foam fights The ceiling leak in Sasha's room has spread The room a wreck covered in tarps Margaret sets up for Sasha to sleep in the living room She opens the pull out couch uses 800 thread sheets to make it feel nice Stephen just stands at the doorframe eating his lean cuisine from the box Blood rushes to Margaret's head And then she says it all in one breath I want to go back to work His eyes get strangely alarmed Did Sasha say anything about you having to go back to work Margaret shakes her head It's just without work I feel old Why does Stephen seem so relieved She finds herself getting angry There's nothing funny about feeling old Stephen puts down his lunch To me you look more striking than ever he says Then he waits And Margaret almost cries because she knows that he means it Gary is on the attack and she hates him We came to because of you Clara fucked up I picked up the pieces You were running away heart is pounding Don't drag that stuff in We need income Gary So you work harder now pull more weight than I will Fuck you The words are out now Spite flying I am a staff writer Gary I don't make the big bucks Maybe you should use your talents for something more lucrative They face off bitterness nesting Heelings close with kindness Why come back to New York Maybe you'll find a wall street man to marry or cheat with I made one mistake in my life she hisses and you won't let me forget Is this the one Is this the fight to undo them You want to go to New York Go ahead Gary she says I'll keep growing up You go ahead and act out He's already left the room as she yells You ask your parents for money if you want to go to New York I'm not paying for any of that I don't want you to go back to Wall Street Maggie says Stephen You need do something you love I want you to be brave They're making Sasha's bed on the pull out couch new sheets a festive Indian bed spread Enjoy your music Relax He pauses Let's revisit the child question if you want You know that ship is sailed Margaret says simply She takes out Alexander's card Her voice all business There's an opportunity for Sasha Alexander's Sakura my old journalist friend is back in New York Did I ever meet Alexander I dated him once she says without meeting his eye He's looking for interns Stephen smiles She'll love it Margaret hands him Alexander's card Sasha won't call him if she thinks it's my lead What you suggest it Stephen nods pulls Margaret close I will And then we'll get you a job that you love Margaret looks at her husband of eight years I really wish we'd had a child when we met She says quietly I really wish we'd been brave Clara puts the birthday card in and walks out into the night What she kept walking and just ran away The mailbox door creaks the cool air feels good Back at the house Gary's upstairs left the lights on Their bottles of wine his and hers His is done Her is almost Clara returns to the kitchen mindless tidying until she finds their joint amix card Messy torn envelope among messy papers The charges of her photographic equipment A new luggage ticket Only one ticket One way to New York Expensive clothes fancy hotel in Tribeca It's the price tag that gets her He sits up in bed All defenses You've got spend money to make money But you're not making any money I'll pay for it Like you said I'll ask my parents What a mess you've made Stop talking Just stop talking Clara She stares at the number Thirty six thousand dollars in the last two months She feels she can't breathe This is half her salary Alexander's third martini arrives with dessert He hands Sasha the olives She shakes her head no P X disappointed I thought you like risks She likes this man He's fun So when do I start It's funny how you just like Margaret He suddenly says Sasha licks the chocolate off her spoon We all look alike My mother me Margaret Alexander waves for the check You look like her but you're nothing like her You're not a girl who likes playing safe Of course that can get you in trouble A shadow crosses her eyes Did my dad tell you why I took a year off I got addicted to prescription pills She holds the candle between them I'm glad you told me says Alexander I don't believe in lies You tell me a truth then Her voice takes Alexander by surprise I'd like to show you my apartment he says Sasha reaches for his martini glass I'll be 21 next month and no one is looking 36 000 dollars Clara is scared She hates scary And in a flash she wishes him dead She walks living room She should sleep on the couch Once in New York when Gary lost their money in the stock market he slept in the closet She turns on a light terrified of being alone defeated tormented pacing then hating herself more than him She crawls back to their room in their bed desperate to recapture his smell She spoons him her face neck Gary please And then his cell rings When people hear someone has died they cover their mouths as if to protect their own breath Gary does that Oh my God that's how she knows It's Jeannie and Tommy's baby He says they found him in his crib He's gone Gary reaches and holds her Clara leans on his chest Gary holds Clara's hand and will not let it go I'm so glad you're here he whispers Their palms are sweaty That's how they find comfort Together In Alexander's apartment the bathroom door is all glass frosted glass Sasha's self conscious is she locks it behind her The bathroom white granite has them been cleaned for a while She puts in her diaphragm Alexander's shadow stops outside the door Red or white she tries to think of something sassy but says red things then adds my own glass The sex is violent harsh Getting too old for this he sucks in his breath In the darkness he whispers you've got this strange power You make me do things admit things Maybe you know She shrugs in the dark You don't know Margaret I we were lovers Who ended it She did he says She was about to marry your dad I was jealous The richness of silence She moves on him slow as if doing nothing until he can't help moan not thinking just moving relentless triumphant Gary chooses a gorgeous funeral wreath all orchids all elegans Clara doesn't ask about the price nodding yes of course the best for their friends How does a baby die When you're not looking babies die A church the congregation is numb Grad students pulled from their studios rub swollen eyes There's no one to blame in a crib death The service is short Clara keeps looking at Jeannie So frail she could break Her family holds her Tommy doesn't Gary holds on to Tommy Leads the pack bereaved friends to a bar He's arranged for them to take over the back Clara looks at him Proud In this alternate universe her husband's a leader getting things done Gary's hand on her arm her pride rising And then he puts everyone's drinks on their card She looks at him but everyone's looking too So she smiles He keeps hugging his friends waving a grief like a column of smoke No one knows what to say So everyone drinks Clara has lost track of time Her phone rings A call from her mom She ignores it The pull out couch covered with the Indian bed spread is empty It's 2am then 3 then 330 Margaret keeps sight reading box second violin concerto Stephen walks out of their bedroom Do you know where she is I can't sleep He looks so distraught I always miss the signs says Stephen I don't listen until it's too late and then something horrible happens Margaret closes her score I'll wait up for her But I always turn Sasha over to you to her mom to a nanny She's almost 21 Margaret says quietly The hard job is done Stephen holds on to her It's not just the boyfriend that has her messed up She saw my bank statement Margaret's blood leaves her body Are we broke We're not doing great She waits for him to continue but he doesn't I need one of your sleeping pills says Margaret reaches for his hand Money comes money goes she says We're both young We can work He looks at her He doesn't feel young but he's grateful The bar is half dark stinks of grief sweat and wine Gary deserves so much better than you Tommy's yelling Clara Why is Tommy yelling at her You look through his mail and you nag make him feel small Tommy's drunk and so angry his spit lands on Clara's black dress What do you want from me Tommy He's up at her face What do I want She pushes him back with all of her strength Tommy falls on the chairs and everyone screams I my child back That's what I want The crowd gathers around him Clara finds Gary at the other end of the bar She's shaking He hasn't noticed a thing Jeannie has Please forgive him Clara I'm so sorry says Clara You can't save the ones that you love Jeannie says and she leaves Gary drives them home taking the turn off the highway so sharp she thinks they'll kill them His drunk his eyes are half closed After the screeches back in control Gary says just one line Do you think they'll make it At 30 a m Sasha wakes up feeling pain jolted forced Alexander pushes her down He wants flesh When she lets him he hisses You are into danger right What the fuck She pushes him off her Her fury overpowers his mass You gossiped me In the glare of the lights he looks flabby unkempt You take all your ex levers daughters to bed Margaret is in your mother Don't get all hysterical He pulls a towel around him You should go I'm not feeling well He walks to the bathroom and locks it You can't stay in there forever she yells Her so fast She throws on her clothes pullens on the door No response That a thump through the frosted glass door His shadow lies still on the floor Sasha smashes the glass with all of her weight So much force So much glass Alexander's spread out Oh my god my god Her mouth on his mouth CPR as she turns on her phone 911 Her wrist has been cut on the glass It's her blood on the granite I think I'm going to cancel the trip to New York says Gary I'll turn down the internship It's not such a big deal I'll stay here Gary opens the fridge These leftovers look amazing When did you make this chili It's a week old We had the party a week ago she says A leftover piece of blue cray paper dangles from the Adobe kitchen frame Backlit by the fridge it catches Clara's eye She looks at this man She's loved for years You've bought your ticket She says quietly You've booked the hotel You bought your supplies You've burdened our life by 36 000 You never discussed it I believe this means New York is calling you Gary I believe you should go She's exhausted She looks at Gary and looks far away He looks smaller a stranger You can't save the people you love She feels cold She's so cold She compulsively scrolls through her phone up to her mother's text Mr Zimler's expecting your call and a number She saves it The emergency vehicles the call to Margaret it's all a blur When Margaret enters the Sasha's never felt such relief She's shocked to see how scared her stepmother looks Her own cut wrist is bandaged That's what Margaret notices I'm okay says Sasha It's just him She's terrified of Margaret's anger but stepmother just holds her Someone says he wouldn't made it without instant care He is one lucky man I want to stay until I know he's okay Sasha and Margaret squeezes her hand It's morning when they exit the hospital Sasha holds on to Margaret just like when she was little They're shaking What did you tell Dad He was asleep I left him a note Said you'd lost your wallet and I needed to get you I love you says Sasha I'm sorry At home after putting Sasha to sleep Margaret writes Alexander an email I'll help you get your article together I'll get you the Wall Street contacts you need but you stay away from my kid The bathroom is full of wet steam Are you sure I should go to New York I'm sure Clara says you'll have a great life You're being a bit too dramatic Gary Scoffs Our friend's baby has died It's that kind of day Through the steam she gathers the courage to say it We're done Gary You and I we're all done She's not going to cry Let's look at it as a new beginning for us He deflects stepping out of his clothes I'll try out New York and then during the winter you'll join me In the mirror she looks at her face Her eyebrows are filled with white hairs I can't live like this anymore She says it's not good for me I'm dying She's crying now When we come back from New York Gary says we should get going with that baby idea She enters the shower crying harder now crying in the shower safe We're done Gary He's right behind her She closes her eyes The baby has died What do you think of my idea He asks but he's already inside her Stephen wakes up Margaret in the middle of the night Sasha's crying go to her he whispers you go Margaret tipped his next to Sasha The crying turns to dry heaves I'm sorry says Sasha Hell of a dream I was alone with my mom She catches herself Looks at Margaret Who nods After she jumped they never let me visit the hospital I've always wondered what if I'd been there Margaret Sasha are quiet You saved someone's life says Margaret finally You couldn't save her but you saved Alexander I know says Sasha It's so weird Sasha gets up I've been meaning to say you play the violin much better than my mom remember her practicing Three colorful foam tubes land on the Indian bed spread I challenge you too Stephen says brandishing the tubes Let's use these to fight His wife and daughter look up Stephen looks like a big bellied clown For a moment on 74th Columbus apartment 90 a mother and daughter There's a dad There is laughter Two months later October 2001 New York City I wish she weren't going back to so soon not until we find Gary Clara puts her arm around mom She looks up so fragile Clara cuts the Scotch tape and Gary's mom chooses the spot for their flyer They walk the city looking for surfaces to plaster their plea missing since 9 11 Gary's face looks up from the flyer elated graduating capping and all They tape his face next to the weathered flyers of missing bankers secretaries firefighters They run out Gary's mom is not done She pulls Clara into the on 72nd Broadway I've noticed the successful flyers How they do it she whispers Successful flyers as Clara The hand of Gary's mom shakes She pulls a faded polaroid out of her purse Gary the toddler bikes on the grass Let's add this photo next then I want you to keep it I'll run us a thousand copies okay Clara says softly The successful flyers make care Gary's mom locks eyes with her daughter in law We need people to care Clara glances mom a few steps ahead scouting out bulletin boards Her own mother's voice comes through the cell clear with purpose as always I'm going to ask you again have you told

these flyers every day These are dead Clara finds herself screaming It's her son Have a heart And then suddenly sees it A missing flyer discarded on the ground Its Margaret's face zeroxed a few too many times Any information please call Clara picks up the flyer She looks at Margaret Black dress and white pearls and her elegance Mother and wife says the flyer Please call Sasha stares at Alexander as if staring at prey A plastic ziplock bag with Margaret's purple toothbrush lies on the bistro table between them I want you to go to the morgue and give this for the DNA sample she says You owe this to Margaret You have to be part of trying to find her Alexander's size he looks so much older You take it Sasha she was your mom She lends in oh she wants to kill him Alexander gets up Go home to your dad Sasha grabs the shoves it in her purse You broke Margaret's heart when you slept with me she hisses I hope her ghost haunts you forever Alexander leaves the 20 for their coffees He doesn't wait for the change Sasha can hear her heart beating out of control as she moves to the bar The barman asks for ID I bet you didn't get to celebrate he says as he looks at the date September 18th He slides over a dirty martini shrugs off money He tries to pick her up but she doesn't let him I couldn't made it without Clara today Gary's mom cuts a thick slice of coffee cake even in deep grief she serves tea with linen napkins and china All around Clara's at photos of Gary cards of sympathy supported on tables An email card from the graduating class of UCLA a bouquet of white orchids from Jeannie and Tommy Clara feels sick The coffee cake rises to her throat This is the third time you've been sick today says Gary's mom Your nerves are a wreck you want some of my Xanax When she's done throwing up Clara remembers to clean everything well Underneath a toilet seat always check that before she settles back in I know he's not dead Gary's mother says Someone's bound to come forward The new flyers much better Clara feels a stare of Gary's father rising up from the New York Times I really think it should make some arrangements and stay with us for a while Clara hugs Gary's mom I can't give up yet the old woman whispers If you were a mother you'd know If you were a mother Clara shivers Clara walks the empty Walmart aisles It's 930 at night Halloween masks and candy Plastic lanterns for the plastic dead She's looking Stopps in front of the pregnancy test She can't keep ignoring the facts The test sits alone in her basket At the cashier's she opens her purse and Margaret's face stares at her from the flyer Haunted Clara walks the half block back to her hotel Excuse me miss The employees at reception surround her with an afterglow of pity Someone's waiting for you at the bar Gary's father stands up A business man he cuts to the chase I had Gary's correspondence forwarded to me I found a letter from a lawyer you hired Zimler Is that right Gary's father is shaking She's been dreading these words Fooling me my wife in our grief I don't want see you again You go back to as you planned It all makes sense now You give a damn Clara sits down to exhausted to cry The hotel clerk brings her a glass of red wine On the house and she can feel his compassion Stephen opens the door of his office to lead out a patient and Clara's right there waiting on the soft maroon couch For one crazy double take moment he thinks is she here because I never answer her letters He waves her in on a reflex What Clara notices His weight and sad eyes The room is padded with sound insulation I know about Margaret she whispers She's missing The chair is uncomfortable No he says in the detached voice of a therapist Margaret is not missing Margaret is dead His hands flex and anger management foam tube When Clara starts crying there's no end to the tears He wants her to stay but she apologizes Later she says I'm so sorry Let me gather myself Clara in her purse for a blank piece of paper I remember yourself he says The sound proof room is so incredibly quiet after Clara leaves Stephen picks up the anger management foam tubes He's about to put them away when he smashes them into his chair The ceiling in is finally fixed Stephen sits in front of a scotch On the TV the Middle East India wars earthquakes crashes He can't stand the news He swallows a sleeping pill Why did Margaret go back to work in September She didn't need to go back to work Sasha folds up the pull out couch Her voice sounds pragmatic I gave Margaret's toothbrush for the DNA file today Stephen hides his face in his hands He only says in town Sasha stops Not even a month since Margaret died you're running into the arms of ex girlfriends She waves her father away Inside her room she tears down the tarps Stopps out of breath Looks at the unopened pile of mail Happy 21st birthday says the card posted in in August Worlds within worlds Creature of the woods and of the seas Let me know how you are Clara's added Sasha tears up the card and tosses it into the garbage At least give us something of his Some closure I beg you Gary's mother is crying on the phone Clara in her hotel room curled up in a ball I don't have his things anymore she says Nothing You have nothing I don't have his toothbrush his comb anything to help with DNA tracking She can hear Gary's father struggling for the phone You

I can only worry about you Clara shakes her head Words dry up in her mouth She hangs up She takes her purse and empties it Gary's toddler Polaroid photo Margaret's flyer The pregnancy test She takes the test in the bathroom and braces herself In front of Margaret's laptop Sasha hits print Margaret's inbox endless scroll on the screen Dear Alexander meet with my colleagues on September 11th I'll get you your piece but I repeat you stay away from my kid Steven's bottle of scotch is almost empty besides Sasha chugs one last sip then takes off She's surprised Alexander opens his door She can see right behind him his bathroom The door is still all frosted glass now fixed She refuses to enter Handsome two zip locks Margaret's nail clippings and hair They're good for DNA too You're morbid He goes to close the door in her face Sasha starts stripping His panicked looks down the hallway thankfully empty He holds onto the zip locks I'll take them to the morgue tomorrow Get dressed But Sasha keeps on I found out why Margaret died I found out why she went to the office Her laughter sounds like a mating hyena Do I look like Margaret now He slams the door shut Shaking in Sasha slips the printed email underneath door On it she's written You killed her Clarice sits next to Steven on his couch She eats his homemade chili Always better than hers Always soothing Served in rustic pottery Not plastic Could Gary be running away from his Why would he even be near the towers Clara feels defensive Gary was creating site specific art He'd never just disappear She tries to concentrate on the reason she's here I need to help his parents if someone writes an article about him Steven rummages through paperwork There's only one journalist I know He hands her a card Alexander's corov An old friend of Margaret's Clara nods Thankful Maybe it's not the best thing to see Sasha today says Steven She's having a very hard time Clara pauses When I sent her birthday card I was so stuck so trapped And now Steven stares at her Clara looks up at the man she once loved Now I feel guilty and scared Clara sits across from Alexander at his makeshift office at ground zero She likes him the way he asks questions how he leans in to listen to details He promises to do his best to get an article out Has anyone seen Gary Loison The room of volunteers hums content work keeps everyone sane When this time passes says Alexander you can come work with me in case you want to stay close until he's found stay close to where he is She's thankful for this unexpected compassion She's thankful for Alexander's corov On 74th in Columbus apartment 9D Steven begins to clean up Box violin concerto fills the apartment as if Margaret's playing He stares at Margaret's mustard stained blouse He still can't bear to clean it folds the Indian bed spread instead He flows with music Grief makes you nauseous In Sasha's room he empties the trash That's when he finds it Clara's torn birthday card And then the empty pill box Margaret's sleeping pills They're all gone Sasha walks into Alexander's offices She's calm rubs her eyes She's suddenly cold She wants to sleep All she wants to sleep She's already dreaming Margaret shows her a window This is the way out she says Sasha wants Alexander to see her She to watch Across the room Clara notices this girl dozing over a volunteer falling asleep on the job So much stress But then she sees Alexander walking over to her shaking the girl yelling at her suddenly angry unrecognizably angry then scared Young people congregate pull rashly away Clara gets up from her chair You cannot save people Juni said that night in L A You cannot save the people you love And then Clara runs No thinking just movement She slaps this girl Alexander watches terrified as Clara screams 9 1 And then she sticks her fingers inside Sasha's throat Sasha moans half opens her eyes and she gags Clara she says Tara and relief Live on Clara's face as she starts CPR I got you Sasha She tells her Steven holds Sasha She's alive She's with him This is not a repeat of last year Sasha whispers I'm here He repeats again and again Father and daughter a tiny unit surrounded by wires and white sheets Steven puts on some music watching his child sleep Clara walks outside in the hallway a nurse passes and smiles at her You should join EMS she jokes once again Want a coffee love Tea Clara nods Checks her watch Her flight leaves in eight hours She feels warm She feels safe And then she looks down at her legs When she walks to the nurse's station she's remarkably calm I'm pregnant she says I think I need an ultrasound I'm bleeding Lying in the semi dark room she keeps her eyes closed as the technician moves over her abdomen You hear it Ask the nurse Clara opens her eyes The black and white images come and go on the screen just like clouds The woman smiles at her You hear it's heart Clara nods Can we tape it She whispers On 30th Street in First Avenue sits a complex of tents Alexander watches the makeshift compound Traffic whistles along the FDR drive The huge white tent is a magnet He knows what's inside Sixteen refrigerated trailers humming engines fragments of lives remains coming in every day Is Margaret in there It started to rain An elderly couple approaches then stops almost embarrassed I'm sorry says the old man We thought you were someone else He thought were our son says his wife But our son is in there She points to the tent She laughs A gentle laugh Full of wonder They found a small fragment a bone Do you have someone in there Alexander pauses I'm sorry says the old man It's not our place to ask I should have died says Alexander Two weeks before 9 11 I had a heart attack If I had died Margaret would still be alive He hears himself saying Clara takes an electric candle out of a Halloween lantern They want to allow open flames at the hospital She ducks as she Sasha's hospital room The hand made happy birthday banner still hits her on the back She places the electric candle on the cupcake Sasha blows and Steven turns off the flame The nurse is applaud Clara keeps hearing the sound the baby's heartbeat in her head Faster than a bird Faster than she ever could have imagined Faster than fear This sound she thinks is the opposite of death On 30th Street First Avenue the rain beats fast against the chalk white canvas Alexander and the old couple stand underneath Approach her leads half a dozen people in prayer Alexander takes lantern The old couple take another and place them at the foot of the trailer Across town Gary's father turns to his wife Clara called he says quietly She says she has something she wants us to hear When Clara heads to the airport it is not yet dawn The taxi driver locks eyes with her in the mirror He's seek His turban blocks her view of the asphalt Clara watches out of the window as morning light rises over Manhattan Out of deep darkness comes the day she thinks The sun is white Fluts Clara's eyes like birth each day
Sheldon slowly walked into the restaurant eyeing the decor suspiciously His roommate Leonard pushed past him and asked the hostess for a table for two As they were led to their chairs Sheldon began to protest yet again Just because next door neighbor is a waitress here it does not logically follow that we have to eat here What's the point of even having a weekly restaurant schedule if we're not going to follow it Leonard sighed and picked up one of the menus on the table You'll live Trust me Everything's good here Statistically unlikely said Sheldon Penny their neighbor came over to the table to take their order Hi guys You ready Sheldon the menu flustered We don't eat here I don't know what's good Just get a hamburger You like hamburgers said Leonard I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers You can't make the assumption that I like the hamburgers here Leonard rolled his eyes and looked at Penny I'm sorry Give him a hamburger Which one the classic burger the ranch house burger the barbecue burger or the Kobe burger Can't we just go to Big Boy asked Sheldon exasperated They only have one burger the Big Boy The barbecue burger is like the Big Boy suggested Penny Excuse me in a world that already includes the Big Boy why would I settle for something like a Big Boy Because you are not at Big Boy said Penny with grimace her patience wearing thin Sheldon threw up his hands and defeat Fine I'll have the barbecue burger Make it too said Leonard handing her the menus Penny smiled at him Thank you Leonard By the way I saw you come home with your date last night I'm so happy for you I returned Sheldon as Penny walked away What did she mean she's happy for me Is she happy because I'm seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy You know because the second person though happy is now romantically unavailable to the first person Sheldon sat back in his chair You're a lucky man Leonard How so We're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought Well what do you think I said I could follow it not that I cared Penny returned with their burgers and Sheldon cautiously took a bite His eyes widened in surprise and he bit off a larger piece You know I think I may have misjudged this restaurant I won't go out on a limb but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger
So I was a junior in college when I got my first paying job in my field on the radio This is not an internship I'm getting a check It was a country in Western radio station And my job though it was only on the weekends was to play the top country hits of the week Each Sunday It actually came on an album pre recorded So I had to take it out of the sleeve and put it on the turntable just so And put the needle down on side one carrying not scratch it And then let Park One play My moment is coming now Yes all the training it's coming now When side one would end I had to lift the needle And here's my moment I get to read the weather live for Jefferson City Missouri Then I played commercials And while the commercials were playing I had to flip the album put it back down on the turntable put the needle back down now on side two and let Park Two of the top country hits of the week play You know when you're getting a degree in communications or broadcasting they teach you all kinds of stuff but they do not teach you how to flip an album In record time before the commercial break ends my career would eventually bring me here to St Louis It's the largest market I had ever been in I was excited and I was nervous And so I am trying to get to know the community And so I'm going to every fundraiser and every event I can think of And after one of those events I promise you it was actually here at the Sheldon in St Louis Missouri A young man approached me outside on the sidewalk He was black And he said to me I knew you were black Now keep in mind that I had heard pretty much my whole adult life You sound white I'd heard that I'd heard oh you sound white You sound like a white girl I'd heard that but I had never ever heard I knew you were black So he tells me about this debate apparently that had been going on in St Louis When I first started here people told him oh no no she's white man she's white She sounds white She's white And he convinced having never met me that I was black Well as it turns out he was right I am black But this whole debate sort of messed with my head a little bit I thought here I am major market fantastic job of my dreams And people still don't know who I am all of who I am So I hatch the secret plan this mission I didn't tell anybody about it I am going to start dropping hints on the air So people will know who I am And so my first hint is me discussing an article I'd read in Essence magazine Anybody Essence Yes you get it Essence magazine course TARGUS African American women And so I think surely now they know they know they got know now debate put to arrest So I am now all about town and people are beginning to recognize me just from my voice I'm at the grocery store I'm chasing my kids at the St Louis Zoo yelling at them people are recognizing my voice I'm drop another hint on the air I'm enjoying the secret mission And so I describe trying to make my mother's collard greens Boom They got know They got to know now that I'm a black woman One day at one of these many events in education panel discussion after it's over I'm in a small group of people and we are talking And an older white gentleman walks up to me And he says you speak well for your people I could feel what you just said I could feel it in my stomach rising to my heart to my throat And I said to him well what people are you referring to Now I knew what he meant We all know what he meant But I wanted him to say it out of his own mouth I wanted him to say it And he said it You know people So now it's really gurgling It is threatening to come spewing out of my mouth I am embarrassed because people are standing around and they're hearing this And I'm angry How dare he diminish me And I'm indignant even And before I could say another word he says to me have you had any training Whew She said well I said nope My father speaks this way my mother speaks this way and they're from Mississippi My siblings all speak this way God given talent No training no classes None of that Just a little old me But I'm still feeling the secret mission So I decide to engage in a drop the moment It's closer to Thanksgiving now when I drop this hint And I describe again one my mother's recipes for cornbread dressing And I took care on the air to say not bread not white bread dressing but cornbread dressing where you make the cornbread the night before And then you soak it Cornbread dressing And I thought boom moment they got to know I'm through I can go home now They know I'm black They know I'm black now And so on the air one day I was just remembering this conversation I'd had with these two women these two petite older black women gray hair quaffed One had a single strand pearls They both had a touch of makeup And one of them took me by each hand and she pulled me close in the other leaned in so she could hear And she said to me we so proud of you And I got a lump in my throat And I knew what they meant They're looking at me this young talented black woman making her mark on this big radio station in St Louis But I'm looking at them They have seen and experienced more than I will ever see or experience or half to see or experience I'm looking at history and its face And I can feel it One day we're in this debate on the air We were talking about was a controversy An organization one of many decided walk out onto the highway Not a road but the interstate And stopped the traffic and shut it down They were protesting the lack of minority jobs in construction And so one of the organizations that was involved was one I knew of from the time I lived in Kansas City Missouri But my co host at the time had never heard of them And so he was truly dismissive And I was truly frustrated And I'm thinking this is a movement moment This is a moment where you either educate or chastise or enlighten I think I'm a do all three But I am also thinking And I am also worried I'm still kind of new here I'm still young I'm a woman I'm black And I'm pregnant And I'm worried about the stereotype of the angry black woman And yet I'm also worried that I don't speak up enough about black issues I'm thinking all of this And I dive right in And I said to him you know they're in the yellow pages You can look up right now and call them They've been around for 50 years And so we took some calls and we ended that conversation turned mics off and left the studio Now just a few weeks ago a gentleman came to our house for a service call to repair the windshield of my car It's right in there in the driveway I met him outside And he said to me have a friend who lives over here And he told me that that news lady lives over here Do you know her And I said pausing feeling pride and trepidation And I said well I am that woman You are I'm Carol Daniel And there it is again He's looking at me He's sizing me up He sized me up in my driveway And I thought did he think I was white Is he surprised now to find that I'm black And I thought the debate apparently the debate is still there in some form or fashion I am not at all sure I can ever really do anything about it There's a lot more at stake There's lot more to juggle in my life There's a lot more weight in my life I just try to not let it weigh me down But this I know I deserve to be here I deserve this job And I don't have this job because I sound white I have this job because I am Good at what I do Thank you
When I get the batons we're the anchor layer the that's a race you run on a track are five yards behind Vince race is over You can have a hundred yarder on Nitorelli And over the course of a mile he would really win he would pass he would win He is the best high school middle distance runner in the Northeast United States His nickname is Machille he runs like a cyborg and he never gets tired Everyone there's about 300 people that stands the track that day everyone knows that he no chance of being beaten Except one guy one guy thinks maybe he can be beaten And that's the guy there's no better There's the guy with a baton there's five yards behind him Why Why did I think that It's weird because I'm not even the best runner on my high school team That's a guy named Tom Nomad But he's been injured So I've known for about a month that I'll be running this anchor but if it's just a deadly relay it has changed Normally I'm sort a lazy athlete I just coast along on my genetic package on a skinny guy with big lungs So I skip workouts I don't run on the weekend But when I hear that I'm running against Vince Nitorelli It's like sports movie montage style I am running all the time every day of the week and I'm throwing in extra workouts Why Why do I do that It's because Nitorelli is from the Bronx where my parents grew up And where the bass is where the tough guys live I am from Westchester County where the main work golf slacks the little dogs wear a face I'm from the place that produces whips And really raises the question of what we inherit And you have a trait that you never get to use because you don't encounter an environment that triggers it In other words are the Bronx guys like Nitorelli tough because they live in the Bronx Or are they tough because they inherit some sort of toughness inherent toughness from their tough Bronx parents that's then triggered by their tough Bronx neighborhoods It could firstly why am I a winner Is it nature Is it nurture I need to know So we're running We're running in this race And the one thing you got to know is my parents didn't follow my athletic career all that closely Although a few weeks before there was an exception My mom drove me to another race in the Bronx And that was kind of unusual And I had her off day and I finished sort of mid pack And as she's driving me home afterwards she turned to me and she said you know I thought you were supposed to be good And that really hurt me Although I could see that as soon as she said it she regretted it So then she turned to me she said okay we're taking a detour I'm going to show you where I grew up the apartment house where I grew up in the Bronx And I think what is I'm 18 years old I'm about to leave for college on the senior high school And I think she wanted to let me know She wanted to show me that she had fought to get out of her neighborhood and out of the working class poverty she grew up with And then you have to fight in this life especially if you want to be good at something So this apartment house she's taking me to she has these beautiful childhood memories Her being a girl that's on a hill near Yankee Stadium and she and her friends used to slay ride and whip her down the hill all the way to the river And in summer her dad would take her the roof at night and he'd shoot off fireworks over the city So that was before the expressways and just mutilated the neighborhood So she knows it's gone downhill but she doesn't know how much She drives her on a corner and she pulls up at the curb in front of this apartment house This place has all of her childhood memories and we look in it's a pile of bricks in an empty lot And it's the only time I ever saw my mother cry My mom and dad used a teacher and he was a government worker They thought the best thing that they could do for me and my brothers is to give us like a perfectly safe and uneventful childhood We grew up in this little suburb Crestwood Norman Rockwell literally painted a picture of Crestwood train station and my parents got a cheap little preventative and put it in a golden frame And hung it over the fireplace on Sunday nights we would all sit on the couch and look at it as we sift our cocoa and watch the wonderful world of Disney on TV So my childhood was like a pasteurized glass of milk I'm about to leave home and I don't know how to operate the stick shift of a car or a checking account or a condom You know you can learn those things and maybe someday I will But what's harder to learn when you grow up sheltered is resilience So I sat in the car and I watched my mom and she cried and she gave herself a admitant And then she stopped And she drove us home She made family She made dinner for our family And later that night she did something just as hard She came into my bedroom and sat down on the she apologized for what she my plan for beating Benz Mitteralli is just stick close over three laps And then end on shoulder for the fourth lap Somehow get to the back stretch and then fight them down the home stretch And when you get to the last lap in a track race the official reaps up when Peter Lennart reached the bell lap I am on his shoulder And that is just shocking to the crowd But everyone knows that Lomm machine is going with me He can just pull away at any time But you know I stay with him around the And now we're we're grounded in out and the back stretch And the crowd is getting excited I'm right next to him and he shoots me This looks like hey who are you And pulls away to a five gargley And I think to myself oh really this really after all this work you just pull away This is how I lose And then I see the chops is stride it's tired So I bring myself back even with him And we go through the final curve and the back stretch The home stretch strides for stride And now the crowd is honest And people are screaming And I even keep pulling out to a little lead he gets even and he passes me And somehow I will myself next to him again And he looks at me again like no really who are you We're 10 feet from along Five feet We lead I win And a few weeks later I will match up again in another race just like this At a much bigger beat called the pain relays and he will bury me But on this day I win Why I think it's because of something my mom It's really the thing I value most I think I inherited just a fraction of her of her high bridge her broth And then she
It's a story that I wrote called The Man Who Forgot例えば Le Berber And I wrote it as a birthday present for Rey on his 91st birthday It begins like this I am forgetting things which scares me I am losing words although I am not losing concepts I hope that I am not losing concepts If I am losing concepts I am not aware of it If I am losing concepts how would I know Which is funny because my memory was always so good Everything was in there Sometimes my memory was so good that I even thought that I could remember things I didn't know yet remembering forward I don't think there a word for that is there remembering things that haven't happened yet I don't have that feeling I get when I go looking in my head for a word that isn't there as if someone must have come and taken it the night When I was a young man I lived in a big shared house I was a student then We had our own shelves in the kitchen neatly marked with our names our own shelves in the fridge upon which we kept our own eggs cheese yogurt milk I was always punctilious about using only my own provisions Others were not so Oh there I lost a word One that would mean careful to obey the rules The other people in the house were not so I would go to the fridge but my eggs would have vanished I'm thinking of a sky filled with spaceships So many of them that they seem like a plague of locusts silver against the luminous move of the night Things would go missing from my room back then as well Boots I remember my boots going Or being gone I should say as I did not ever actually catch them in the act of leaving Boots do not just go Somebody went them LAUGHTER like my big dictionary Same house same time period I went to the small bookshelf beside my bed Everything was by my bed It was my room but it was not much larger than a cupboard with a bed in it I went to the shelf and the dictionary was gone just a dictionary sized hole in my shelf to show where my dictionary wasn't All the words in the book they came in were gone Over the next month they also took my radio a can of shaving foam a pad of note paper and a box of pencils And my yoghurt And I discovered during a power cut my candles Now I'm thinking of a boy with new tennis shoes who believes he can run forever No that's not giving it to me A dry town in which it rained forever A road through the desert on which good people see a mirage A dinosaur that is a movie producer The mirage was the pleasure dome of Kublai Khan No Sometimes when the words go away I can find them by creeping up on them from another direction See I look for a word I'm discussing the inhabitants of the planet Mars say And I realize that the word for them has gone I might also realize that the missing word occurs in a sentence or a title The Chronicles My favorite If that does not give it to me I circle the idea little green men I think or tall dark skinned gentle Dark they were and golden eyed And suddenly the word Martians is waiting for me like a friend or a lover at the end of a long day I left that house when my radio went It was too wearing The slow disappearance of the things I had thought so safely mine item by item Thing by thing Object by object Word by word When I was 12 I was told a story by an old man that I'd never forgotten A poor man found himself in a forest as night fell and he had no prayer book to say his evening prayers So he said God who knows all things I have no prayer book and I do not know any prayers by heart But you know all the prayers You are God So this is what I'm going to do I'm going to say the alphabet and I will let you put the words together There are things missing from my mind it scares me Icarus It's not as if I've forgotten all names I remember Icarus He flew too close to the sun In the stories though it's worth it always worth it to have tried even if you fail Even if you fall like a meteor forever better to in the darkness to have inspired others to have lived then to have sat in the darkness cursing the people who borrowed but did not return your candle I have lost people though It's strange when it happens I don't actually lose them in the way one loses one's parents Either there's a small child when you think you're holding your mother's hand in a crowd and then you look up and it's not your mother Or later when you have to find the words to describe them at a funeral service or a memorial or when you're scattering ashes on a garden of flowers or into the sea I sometimes imagine I would like my ashes to be scattered in a library But then the librarians would just have to come in early the next morning to sweep them up again before the people got there I would like my ashes scattered in a library or possibly a fun fare In 1930s fun fare where you ride the black the black I've lost the word Carousel rollercoaster The thing you ride and you become young again the Ferris wheel Yes there is another carnival that comes to town as well bringing evil by the pricking of my thumbs Shakespeare I remember Shakespeare and I remember his name and who he was and what he wrote He's safe for now Perhaps there are people who forget Shakespeare They would have to talk about the man who wrote to be or not to be No not the film starring Jack Benny whose real name was Benjamin Koebelski who was raised in Waukegan Illinois and I were also outside Chicago Waukegan Illinois was later immortalized as Greentown Illinois in a series of stories and books by an American author who left Waukegan and went to live in Los Angeles I mean of course the man I'm thinking of I can see him in my head when I close my eyes I used to look at his photographs on the back of the books He looked mild and he looked wise and he looked kind He wrote a story about Poe to stop Poe being forgotten about a future where they burn books and they forget them And in the story we are on Mars although we might as well be in Waukegan or Los Angeles as critics as those who would repress or forget books as those who would take the words all the words dictionaries and radios full of words as those people are walked through a house and murdered one by one by a rangutan by pit and pendulum for the love of God Montressor Poe I know Poe and Montressor and Benjamin Koebelski and his wife Sadie Marks who was no relation to the Marks brothers and who performed as Mary Livingston All these names in my head I was 12 I'd read the books I'd seen the film and the burning point of paper was the moment where I knew that I would have to remember this because people would have to remember books if other people burn them or forget them We will commit them to memory We will become them We become authors We become their books I'm sorry I lost something there I was walking that dead ended and now I'm alone and lost in the forest and I'm here and I do not know where here is anymore You must learn a Shakespeare play I will think of you as Titus Andronicus or you My friend you could learn an Agatha Christine novel You will be murder on the Orient Express Someone else could learn the poems of John Wilmot Earl of Rochester and you whoever you are listening to this you can learn a Dickens book And when I want to know what happened to Barnaby Rudge I will come to you You can tell me And the people who would burn the words the people who would take the books from the shelves the firemen and the ignorant the ones afraid of tales and words and dreams and Halloween and people who have tattooed themselves with stories And boys you can grow mushrooms in your cellar and as long as your words which are people which are days which are my life are words of I then you lived and you mattered and you changed the world and I cannot remember your name I learned your books burned them into my mind in case the firemen came to town But who you are is gone I wait for it to return to me just as I waited for my dictionary or for my radio or for my boots and with just as me got a result All I have left is the space in my mind where you used to be And I'm not so certain about even that I was talking to a friend and I said at these stories familiar to you I told him all the words I knew the ones about the monsters coming home to the house with the human child in it the ones about the lightning salesman and the wicked carnival that followed him and the Martians and their fallen glass cities and their perfect canals I told him all the words and he said he hadn't heard of them but they didn't exist And I worry I worry I was keeping them alive like the people in the snow at the end of the story walking backwards and forwards remembering repeating the words the stories making them real I think it's God's fault I mean he can't be expected to remember everything God can't Busy chap So perhaps he delegates things sometimes just goes you I want you to remember the dates of the Hundred Years War and you you remember a copy You remember Jack Benny who was Benjamin Kabelski from Warkegan Illinois and then when you forget the thing that God has charged you with remembering bam no more a copy just in a copy shaped hole in the world which is halfway between an antelope and a giraffe No more Jack Benny no more Warkegan just a hole in your mind or a person or a concept used to be I don't know I don't know where to look Have I lost an author Just as once I lost dictionary Or worst did God give me this one small task and now I have failed him And because I have forgotten him he has gone from the shelves gone from the reference works and now he only exists in our dreams My dreams I do not know your dreams Perhaps you do not dream of a belt that is only wallpaper but that eats two children Perhaps you do not know that Mars is heaven where I beloved dead go to wait for us then consumers in the night You do not dream of a man arrested for the crime of being a pedestrian I dream these things If he existed then I lost him Lost his name lost his book titles one by one by one Lost the stories And I fear that I am going mad for I cannot just be growing old If I have failed in this one task or God then only let me do this thing you may give the stories back to the world Because perhaps if this works they will remember him All of them will remember him His name will once more become synonymous with small American towns at Halloween when they leave skitter across the sidewalk like frightened birds or with Mars or with love And my name will be forgotten I'm willing to pay that price if the empty space in the bookshelf of my mind can be filled again before I go Dear

Chandler and Monica walked into the airport hand in hand pulling their suitcases behind them See honey No problem getting a cab No traffic My way totally works Smile Chandler Monica took a deep breath I know I know we have plenty of time I am totally relaxed totally calm Suddenly her eyes grew wide as she saw the line for airport security Landing in a lengthy tangle that stretched all the way around the corner Monica scurried toward the end of the line with Chandler following behind 'We'll be fine he said as he caught up to her We've still got time to make our flight Just think about how relaxing it's going to be once we're on the way to our honeymoon Hamacs pin your colladas He started to sway his hips from side to side Bermuda Baha ma come on pretty mama Monica perched her lips but the corners of her mouth turned up in a smile They eventually made it to the front of the line to go through the metal detector Monica began methodically removing her watch and belt and started to search through her pockets to check for change 'Could you hurry up a man behind them shouted glaring at her She turned around in shock 'Hey I have never set one of these off before and I am not about to start now she scolded holding up her finger She started to walk through then jumped back and bent down She took off her ankle and put it in her box on the conveyor belt She smiled at the security guard That was a close one Her joy was cut short as they heard the final call for their flight come over the PA system gate is on the other side of the terminal Monica shouted holding her hands to her head Chandler looked around in shock and then ran over to an elderly man on an electric scooter 'I will give you 60 he said shoving a wad of cash into the man's hand If you let us borrow your scooter to get the gate B 75 The old man looked back at him in surprise then slowly stepped back off the scooter Chandler gestured wildly to Monica who hopped on the back of the scooter while Chandler took the wheel and accelerated down the concourse Weaving between passengers and luggage they screeched to the gate just before it closed and hurried down the jetway They finally collapsed into their seats on the plane Next time we're going to the airport my way said Monica wiping her forehead Four hours early Chandler closed his eyes and leaned his head back on the seat and smiled Whatever you want Right now all I can think is Burmuda Bahama come on pretty mama Monica laughed
Barney and Quinn walked into the airport pulling their matching pink tiger stripe suitcases Barney leaned over and kissed her on the cheek This is going to be an amazing week I'm so glad we were able to put everything that happened behind us He looked back at his neon colored suitcase and frowned Well almost everything Quinn rolled her eyes Hey you're lucky I only threw out your luggage Next time you storm off to Atlantic City after a fight you'll be wearing hot pinks to let us Barney hoisted the bags onto the security conveyor belt and they stepped through the body scanner One of the security guards weaved them over and held up Barney's suitcase Sir is this yours She asked incredulously Yes it is he said with a sigh The guard placed the suitcase on a table and opened it up revealing a silver metal cube about a foot long on each side What is that Quinn looked equally confused Yeah what is that Barney pointed to it nonchalantly It's a magic trick You see I'm something of a magician The guard motioned to several others for backup Sir you need to open this box Oh I can't do that Magicians code A magician never reveals his tricks The only person I could possibly reveal the trick to is another magician On cue one of the security guards stepped forward I'm a magician he said pulling out a deck of cards from his breast pocket Barney shrugged Fair enough He leaned over and whispered in the guards here The guard raised his eyebrows and smiled Oh I see All right you're free to go He zipped up Barney's bag and handed it back to him Quinn followed Barney down the concourse in total confusion Magic trick Why wouldn't he tell her what was in the box She tried to interrogate him as they sat in front of the gate but he refused to spill the beans I told you magician's code As they boarded the plane and found their seats Barney placed the bag on his seat pulled out the box and handed it to Quinn He took a key from his pocket and handed it to her pointing to a small keyhole in the side of the cube As she turned the key the lid of the cube opened revealing a small flowerpot filled with dirt As she looked to Barney in confusion a green stock pushed its way out of the dirt and climbed several inches out of the box On its end was a red rosebud Passengers and flight attendants were gathered around their seats staring with Quinn as the rosebud began to open In its center was a diamond ring which Barney plucked from the flower and held out to Quinn Quinn will you marry me
Okay so getting back to our story about Lucy This is a story that begins in 1964 and it's one that Charles would have never heard about heading out bumped into this obscure old memoir Long at a print Yeah what's the name of the book Do you actually have it with you Yeah hold on It's called Lucy Growing Up Human a chimpanzee daughter in a psychotherapist family by Maurice K Tamerlin Maurice K Tamerlin he is the psychotherapist He's a psychotherapist And he's also the dad in this story And his wife Jane who's a social worker she's the mom Now the thing to know was that especially for Maurice Tamerlin this was more than just adopting a baby chimp This was an experiment He wanted to know given the right upbringing how human could Lucy become You know what he says early on in this book would she learn to love us and perhaps have other human emotions as well Would she be well behaved rebellious intelligent or stupid What about sex Maurice Tamerlin actually died in 1989 but these are his words read by Radio host David Garland Would she mother her offspring Could she learn to talk How intelligent might she be And so how did they get her He says that he and his wife Jane made all the arrangements went and got the chimp from day the infant was born The mother was anesthetized in the early morning of her second day Jane fed the mother a Coca Cola which had been spiked with fensiclidine a drug which puts chimpanzees into a deep pleasant sleep And the baby was taken away Jane named her Lucy and brought her home on a commercial airline carried in a bassinet her face covered with a lacy blanket We were blissfully unaware The complexities we were creating on the day Lucy came home So the baby was a dare tool Just two days old So wasn't No And that was part of the experiment They bottle feeder Yeah She quickly learned to hold her own bottle At two months her eyes would focus At three months she was trying to climb out of her crib to go to people And at six months she was pretty mobile on all four limbs Memoran goes on By the time she was about a year old She was eating at the table with us Forks spoons would see us using silverware and immediately do so herself She began to dress herself in skirts She would often grab my hand pull me to my feet and beg me to chase it Always looking back to see that daddy was not too far behind You know he really went at this with this sort of full bore earnestness You know when he calls her his darling daughter and I took great pride in my daughter's achievement he does feel like a real parent to Lucy She was so responsive to being looked at held and stroked But he's also to make no mistake treating this as a very intense cutting edge experiment The next phase of the experiment which occupies a good deal of the book involves one of those talents that we thought used to have only been limited to us Language Okay Can you introduce yourself please Okay My name is Roger Fowth I'm a professor of psychology and I've worked with chimpanzees since 1967 Roger Fowth was called in by Maurice Temerlin to address one of you know crucial questions of the experiment learn to talk Right And at the time he was the guy He'd just been part of a team that had proven for the first time that chimps could use sign language to communicate So his job with Lucy was to teach her how to sign And I think I came into her life when she was as I remember it was 1977 I think it was four or five She was four or five years old Roger taught her signs for airplane baby doll ball banana barrette right Very Yeah Yeah So I was sort of like blanket The two ter friend babysitter that would come over for a few hours though tied each day and spend some time just you know just playing with Lucy Candy I would work on signs Candy We'd read books together or we'd go for walks and I would chat with her basic Cry Dirty And he says that Lucy just sort of picked it up Picked it all up It was like a game She learned some 250 signs And the big question is okay so is it mere mimicry Or are they able to spontaneously create words Yeah And put them together in a new original way And there's been a lot of anecdotal evidence that in fact Lucy did spontaneously create words In a later session when she owned a piece of watermelon Lucy tasted it And she called it candy drink And a radish had gotten quite old and one day you know she was calling it food and food for I think several days of the study And then she decided to eat this old radish and she took a bite and spit it out I said well what is that She called it cry hurt food Wow She would also lie to me Really Yes yeah yeah And lying we should also say is of those things that people used to think only we do During one of my sessions I came in and she had a potty accent that she had been potty trained but sometimes she didn't always make it to and I was upset because I was now faced with having to clean it up And so I said who's is that And she said Sue Who's Sue Sue was one of one of my students that would come in and spend time with Lucy too I said no Sue's not here And finally she blamed it on and said Lucy and sorry And so Sue Yes This is Sue Sue's having drum ball The grad student of yours who says she didn't actually see that lie and take place Yes well I wasn't there she told us that when she met Lucy she was blown away by incongruity of it all Like for instance every time she would walk in the house Lucy would just walk casually into the kitchen and search through the cupboard for the kind of tea she wanted that day and put some water in a kettle and put it on the stove and make us tea Yeah became a routine I'd come in and she would start the tea It was the casualness with which she did it The kind of air about it that yes I'm making tea and I would like you to have some too because tea is what we do And so the thing to do was to sit down and to casually sip the tea with Lucy and casually look through the magazines listen to the radio and what magazines would she look at Well she looked at I think House and Garden and some magazines and pictures of women and children and them whatever the Timmerlands had out Wow Lucy had developed an awareness of our emotions If Jane is distressed Timmerland's wife Lucy notices it immediately and attempts to comfort her by putting her arm about her grooming her or kissing her If Jane is sick Lucy would exhibit tender protectiveness to order bringing her food sharing her own food And as we get to this next part this sort of the midpoint of the memoir it's useful to sort of remember a basic fact of biology Speciation happens when you've got one group of creatures that gets divided into two and then these two groups evolve away from one another and eventually they get so far away from each other that they can have babies And nature make sure that they can have babies by making one species basically undesirable to the other You look across you're a baboon you look across at a chimpanzee Yeah you're only sexually attracted to your own kind That is essentially what a species is Now this isn't something you're supposed to be able to learn or unlearn This is just the way it is Yeah I was there when she was introduced to her first adult male chimpanzee Had Lucy ever seen another chimpanzee before We've never seen another chimpanzee from the moment of birth Wow She says they brought this male chimpanzee To see if Lucy was attracted to chimpanzee males And was she Well the male chimpanzee would sit there with his hand held out toward her and she was very frightened and she tried to move away It was then says Sue that she realized that in every way that mattered Lucy was no longer a chimpanzee She was stranded Right in between this great divide that I knew was there between humans and non humans And I did not know how to negotiate this There is no category in our language except a mythical one for something that's not human and not animal So
set Okay so the thing starts with like this kind of beachy scene almost with sand and then you kid Merlin starts walking up it flashes their bunch of like scenes are just traveling like their fairly rural areas and is upbeat and happy and then like the title scene the credits roll with the music and you see like a bunch of like medieval imagery and fire and stuff So then after that kid just keeps walking he's on a town with like lots of people It's very obviously like medieval times He's got like this backpack and stuff and he's traveled a long way we understand So everyone's congregated and he joins this crowd of people and we see this other man being let up to like something by two guards and we understand that executed and then the king of I don't yeah I guess just the king He starts talking he says that this man is going to be killed because he practiced magic and that he's going to serve as an example to not do that So then the man is killed Everyone looks really horrified The whole time there's a scroll in the window but I guess we're we're supposed to a war that keeps being shown After the man is killed the king says like what the festivities began and I guess they're celebrating like not using magic in the kingdom So the crowd fully disperses this woman starts screaming and turns out that she's the executed man's mother and she's pretty distressed calls the king the only evil thing says that before the festivities are over he's going to do one of his kids can be dead anyways and then poor the guards can see their kind of like turns into this tornado and disappears So then Marlon leaves kind of shaken he goes to the the court position and he has the court position So when he goes into the room the guys standing on top of like a balcony kind of thing and we start all some so the court position he falls but before he can fall on the ground Marlon who is magical that kind of catches him and then slides the bed under him so he lands on it nicely So the guys shocked that the Marlon just passed it off as like do anything and then later just in with magic So he hands the guy the letter and then the guy tells him to let go The summer soon or before there's a scene with the woman that we saw in the window earlier Here's how she's some kind of daughter of the king's and so the king is just annoyed at all this magic stuff and the daughter is annoyed at how brutal the king was with everything and doesn't tell him so and then he orders her to see some sort of singer or something and she had first refuses but then he gets angry so she does it Oh we see the court position reading the letter that he got and so what happened was Marlon's mother sent him there so that he could get some of protection or kind of treating with guidance or guidance While he because of his magic powers or gifts that she calls him So in the next morning we yeah so Marlon goes like each breakfast the guy kind of like on purpose knocks over a pale of water and sees Marlon again like he's instinctively like stop it from falling with magic and again he questions him like that's like asking him where he learned this stuff how he came to have supernatural powers him off on errands he to deliver like these two things of medicines to these two different people so Marlon does that the first guy like pretty blind just trucks it all at once even though he wasn't supposed to And then his honest way to deliver the second one he sees this blonde guy kind of in a suit and this other like smaller I mean I got to work so kind of present kid The blonde guy is excited by a bunch of his posse The other kid is alone and the other kid has this massive target like this big wooden thing and the blonde guy is like aggressively throwing weapons at him and calling it target back is just generally being aggressive about that all and then so the small guy actually falls down because he gets exhausted And Marlon is there and he tells at first he's nice and tells the blonde guy his crew like okay that's enough but then the blonde guy doesn't like to hear that and they get into like something of like a verbal argument Marlon calls on my friend here responds with no in it ends with Marlon trying to punch the guy who would now is Arthur a king son and he easily disarms Marlon and the guards take Marlon away and the next thing we see is him waking up in a cell So in this cell that's the most notable thing is when he wakes up he hears this like eerie voice just saying Marlon burn over and over again and he seems to the ground or somewhere under him But then his caretaker the crevosition comes back in tells Marlon he pulled a couple strings and he could go So that happens with the one exception that he has to like one of those medieval things where he sticks his arms and head through like this holds in a panel more or less and these kids are like throwing fruits and vegetables at him It's all a good fun that he's laughing and then this a woman comes by and she was there when he defended the like the kid and then she says she's kind of joking around with him just saying like oh that was really brave and said but it like a good thing you get to fight with Arthur because like he's kind of like he couldn't beat up Arthur more or less as her ideas And he laughs it off and that's it So before or after all that there's a scene the woods so there's this tent and there's a woman inside it and she hears a noise outside and turns out to be one of her guards or something and he comes in and we let she's headed towards the castle And then later he goes out tries to like he hears some noise out the woods he checks what it is We don't see anything but next we hear a scream from like this is a scene being twisted inside the tent and then another figure approaches the tent and this time it's like this old kind of a crap at lady Probably she looks like the woman who the son or the mother of the man who has executed so yeah she's this wish she comes in she has like this of voodoo doll but she to have a couple of times and then the woman in the tent kind of falls over and is silent and still and then she has this potion thing on a necklace that she keeps rubbing and then so is a couple of words of like in campaigns to it it glows and she turns into the woman who was used to be like alive and well in the tent and then she looks the mirror though and the mirror shows that she's still this like kind of old witch So yeah that's that scene and then the next time we see her she is coming off of a horse and walking into the castle So oh and also once she steps off we see that you know water reflects like who she really is which is like this old witch and that like young or not lady So she kind of walks in the king is very very happy to see her We learn that she like a singer for all like the festival stuff that's going on and then so he just makes sense out of and says thanks for coming So Merlin is like out again and this time wait no not yet this time he is sent to give the her like this singer like this little thing for her voice a while soon will be a little bit of medicine for voice and he goes to her like room I guess and he puts it down at first because no one's there and you notice is like that voodoo doll that she had stabbed he she had been stabbing in the tent and then he looks fairly confused and kind of concerned and then he like moves this little sheet off and it's a stack of I guess what we would understand if they spell books or something and he's looking at it also fairly confused The scene then cuts to the lady and she she looks concerned she is really to her room and turns around quickly walks towards it and just as she is to come in Merlin quickly puts the book down like covers it back up and she comes in says what are you doing here and just gives her the medicine tells she was there to deliver that and please So yeah and then somewhere in another conversation with the court position we learned that there are all the dragons had been killed 20 years ago because magic like sent this world into chaos except for one which is underneath the castle So there's a bit of foreshadowing and then so Merlin bumps into Arthur and his gang on street again and at first one Arthur calls out to him to ignore them but then are they just keep talking and he can't ignore them anymore and then so He being Merlin keeps like kind of over bravado way like oh like I could beat you up with like less than a sword or whatever he had said So Arthur doesn't like this not sure what the term is for it but the like stick with the chain on the end but you kind of whoop around the hurt people So Arthur comes after him with one of those and at first Merlin is super clumsy all he can do is run away There are like portions of the town kind of getting destroyed Yeah he like it's very busy out he's like bumping into people lots of fruit is getting smashed like running over fruit cards and stuff and then he kind of goes back into this alleyway and he's like he tripped and fell on this pile of stuff and Arthur standing over him like swinging this bumping around but then he uses magic and like these meat hooks nearby and then like he aligns them perfectly so that one Arthur is swinging his like chain thing around it got trapped up and then like kind of Merlin's chance he jumps up and then now like like a bunch of scenes of him doing little things to trip up like literally he moves his in front of him one Arthur is trying to come after him so he jumps over it and then he hides again and then Arthur still gets up he's coming after him and he pulls this rope top so he jumps over that as well And then so Arthur is now the one falling all over the place and by now a fairly large crowd has gathered and we see that the court position is also there like like looking at Arthur we see a small smile on his part And yeah so Arthur let's say him and there is an ending that I can't recall right now Yeah that's it
He took a deep breath and tried to calm down The situation seemed almost hopeless and after he spent most of the last week's drinking he knew he must confront the truth He looked at his reflection in the mirror and started sobbing uncontrollably That evening at his deepest moment of despair he did the unthinkable calling his mother to consult In general advice from his mother resembled a long and gruesomely painful lecture about all the big mistakes he had made in his life Starting from how he thought to stay in his mother's womb up to the way he had ruined the relationship with Emily Lamore To be honest this wasn't far from the truth His mother had gone through almost 40 hours of painful labor He could imagine though he never actually tried it could have gone better But to this day every time he looked at his mom's belly he felt that it was the only place that truly felt safe and warm As for Emily it wasn't that simple as nothing in life ever is He did mistreat her at times and well he did take her for granted although she was better than anything he could ever hope for he could go on and on and on about all the things that went wrong But it was beside the point He learned his lesson or so he told everyone never understanding what the lesson was and how the hell was he supposed to learn it His mother recognized his regular routine and said to him impatiently I'm so tired of you Thomas Listen to me This might sound a bit wacky but have you considered the idea of seeing hypnotist about your broken heart Oh mom That is just a stupid idea I'm not that desperate Dearest I hope you aren't He sometimes hated his mom for her brutal honesty but she had a point Okay mom I'll look into it He said mechanically as he hung up and thought to himself what do I have to lose He woke up early the next morning and frantically scanned the web for the combination of best and cheapest therapists Before long he understood that knowing nothing about the subject it was hard to figure out which therapist was the best He would have to settle for the cheapest one he could find Andre the Giant chiropractor and hypnosis therapist my back guaranteed The combination was a bit odd but just the thought of Princess Bride which was his all time favorite movie by far made the choice so much easier A low voice answered his call It's your lucky day Mr Smith Somehow a fake name felt safer I have a cancellation for 10 am today but it's going to be chilly so be sure to wear a scarf He arrived at Andre's clinic at 56 and Andre who to his disappointment was a surprisingly short giant welcomed him in I hate Wednesdays he said For some reason everyone seems to be sick I know what you mean I used to be in the toilet paper industry Thomas replied feeling that was an eccentric response So are you interested in chiropractic therapy or are you here just for hypnosis session Andre asked Just the hypnosis session My back seems to be just fine these days thank you Thomas said assertively sure man Andre replied and coughed What seems to be bothering you Mr Smith It's Emily the greatest girl in the world I can't stop thinking about her We were supposed to marry in the spring but I was afraid to commit I'm still obsessed with her I dream about her constantly and I imagine her face in almost every woman I see To be honest you are the 20th therapist I've gone to Do you like chocolate Mr Smith Thomas didn't understand the relevance of the question but he replied nevertheless I'm not crazy about it but I take a bite now and then Just keep your eyes on the Milky Way Andre said as he started to gently dangle a miniature Milky Way which was tied to a string Aren't you supposed to do that with a silver watch Thomas said doubtfully quote trust in Andre and everything will be just fine He took a deep breath and tried not to laugh The next thing he remembered was waking up and feeling like he could really use a good chiropractic therapy When he left Andre's clinic an hour later he felt better than he had for ages It was like a miracle His back felt great and he had new hope in his heart As he strolled down the street he spotted a girl that looked exactly like Emily but after another second he realized that he was imagining Feeling better he stopped to buy a Milky Way and continued walking home light hearted As days went by he noticed that he was dreaming about Emily less than ever He was finally ready to meet her He called his ex and eventually persuaded her to meet with him at a bar the next day When he arrived at the bar Emily was looking at her watch How are you doing Emily He asked not losing control of his body for a change I have been better How are you these days Getting better he answered Actually believing in the words that he was saying I have to go to the ladies room Do you want anything She inquired softly No I'm fine I was just hoping to talk about our past he answered By the way do you have Milky Way on you by any chance What No She answered looking at him tenderly Thomas felt like a confident man It's fine jiffy he said as he leapt to find a vending machine On his way to his seat while swallowing what was left of his chocolate he smiled to himself why didn't I go to that wacky hypnotist earlier I must never admit this to mom He moved the chair with a big smile on his face I see Andre about my new weight problem as soon as possible he thought as he started tapping on his newly acquired belly I'm not sure
The mountain took a deep breath and tried to calm down The situation was almost desperate and after Martin spent most of the last week's drunk he knew it was time to face reality Martin looked at the reflection in the mirror and started weeping uncontrollably That evening at the utmost moment of hopelessness Martin did the inconceivable calling his mom to talk In general help from his mom resembled a lengthy and very excruciating lecture about all the things he had done wrong in his life Starting from how Martin struggled to remain in his mom's belly up to how Martin had messed up everything with Sophia Jones To be honest it wasn't far from the truth His mom had gone through nearly 30 hours of agonizing labor Martin could imagine though he never really tried It could have gone easier But to this day each time Martin looked at his mom's belly he felt that it was the only time he really felt protected and loved As for Sophia it wasn't that simple as nothing in life ever is Martin had treated her badly sometime and well Martin did take Sophia for granted although Sophia was better than anything Martin could ever hope for and Martin could go on and on and on about all the things that ended poorly But it was beside the point Martin learned the lesson or so he told everybody not understanding what the lesson was And how the heck was he supposed to learn it Martin's mom identified his usual habit and spoke to him annoyed I'm so fed up with you Martin Listen to me This might sound a bit crazy But have you explored the idea of seeing a healer about your painful breakup Wow Mom That was just a dumb idea I'm not that desperate Dearest I wish you weren't Martin sometimes hated his mother or her harsh candor but she had a point Fine Mom I'll check it out Martin said dispassionately he hung up and mumbled to himself What do I have to lose Martin woke up at dawn the next morning and anxiously scanned the internet for the combination of best and inexpensive healer Before long Martin understood that knowing nothing about the subject it was hard to figure out which healer was the best And would have to compromise for the most inexpensive one he could get Andre the Giant hypnosis and physiospecialist customer satisfaction guarantee The combination was kind of strange but just thinking about the Princess Bride which was Martin's all time favorite film by far made the choice much more easy A deep voice answered Martin's call Today's your lucky day Mr Williams Somehow a fake name felt comforting I have a place at 1 pm today but it's going to be cold so be sure to bring a coat Martin arrived at Andre's clinic at 27 and Andre that to Martin's dissatisfaction was a surprisingly small man invited him in I dislike Thursdays Andre said for some reason everyone seems to be ill I know what you mean I used to be in the bathroom tissue industry Martin replied feeling that was an unconventional response So are you interested in physiowirk or you came here only for hypnosis session Andre asked just they have noses please My neck seems to be just perfect these days Thank you Martin replied confidently Okay dude Andre replied and coughed What seems to be worrying you Mr Williams It's Sophia the best girl on planet earth I can't stop thinking of her The wedding was supposed to happen in the summer but I was scared to marry I'm totally obsessed with Sophia I dream about Sophia constantly and I see her image in practically every woman I meet To be honest you are the 30th council I've spoken to Do you enjoy candy Mr Williams Martin didn't understand the relevance of the question though he replied nevertheless I'm not crazy about it but I eat a little now and then Just keep your eyes on the Kit Kat Andre replied while he started to gently swing a small Kit Kat that was dangling from a cord Aren't you supposed to do that with a pocket clock Martin asked doubtfully Put your face in Andre and everything will be just fine Martin took a deep breath and tried not to laugh The next thing Martin remembered was slowly awakening and feeling like he could certainly use a good physio session When Martin exited Andre's clinic an hour later he felt happier than he felt for years It was like a blessing Martin's neck was relaxed plus he felt rising optimism in his soul As he walked down the street Martin noticed a woman that appeared exactly like Sophia Though after a second he understood that he was fantasizing Feeling good he stopped to purchase a Kit Kat and continued walking home unburdened As days went by Martin noticed that he was thinking about Sophia less and less He really felt prepared to see Sophia Martin called Sophia's cell and finally convinced her to come with him to the pub the next day When Martin arrived at the pub Sophia was staring at the clock How are you doing Sophia He inquired without losing control over his voice this once I could be worse How are you these days Feeling better he replied actually believing that the response he made was true I have to go to the bathroom Do you need anything Sophia inquired quietly No I'm fine I was just eager to discuss our former relationship Martin replied By the way do you have a Kit Kat on you by any chance What No Sophia answered looking at Martin sympathetically Martin felt like a new person That's okay be back in a jiffy Martin said while he jumped to find a nearby kiosk On the way to their table while munching what was left of the Kit Kat Martin laughed at himself Why didn't I go to Andre the giant sooner I must never admit this to mom Martin pushed his stool with large foolish grin on his lips I have to visit Andre about my new size problem as soon as possible Martin thought while he began to pat his rapidly growing stomach
She took a deep breath and tried to calm down The situation seemed too good And after she spent most of the last week's worrying she knew she could enjoy the moment She looked at her reflection in the mirror and started laughing uncontrollably That evening at her biggest moment of triumph she did the expected calling her mother to brag In general conversations with her mother resembled an intense and unbelievably optimistic lecture about all the good things she had accomplished in her life starting from how she managed to slide from her mother's womb up to the way she had reached the finals in American Idol To be honest it wasn't far from the truth Her mother had gone through only two hours of relaxed labor She could imagine though she never actually tried it could have gone worse But to this day every time she looked at her mom's belly she felt that it was a safe haven that truly felt nice and warm As for Idol it wasn't that simple as nothing in life ever is She did pick a great song and well she did take it for granted although it was better than anything she could ever hope for and she could go on and on and on about all the things that worked out And it was beside the point She learned her lesson or so she told everyone not understanding what the lesson was and how the hell was she supposed to learn it Her mom recognized her elated mood and said to her enthusiastically I'm so proud of you Rachel Listen to me This might sound a bit obnoxious but have you forgotten the idea of seeing a psychic about your stage fright Wow mom That was just a fleeting idea I'm not that desperate Bam bee I know you aren't She sometimes hated her mom for her random comments but she had a point Sure mom I'm done with that She said hesitantly as she hung up and thought to herself what do I have to lose She woke up late the next morning and calmly scanned the newspaper for the combination of best and nearest psychic Before long she understood that knowing nothing about the subject it was hard to figure out which psychic was the best She would have to settle for the nearest one she could find Her mayonee the great pedicurist and fortune teller money back guaranteed The combination was kind of intriguing and just the thought of Harry Potter which was her all time favorite book by far made the choice even more exciting A sweet voice answered her call It's your lucky day Ms Monroe Somehow a fake name felt sexier I have a place at 5 pm today but it's going to be rainy so be sure to bring an umbrella She arrived at Hermione's clinic at 5 36 and Hermione who to her delight was a surprisingly beautiful magician welcomed her in I love Tuesdays she said For some reason everyone seems to be happy I know what you mean I used to be in the phone book industry Rachel replied feeling that was a satisfactory response So are you interested in pedicurist session or are you just here for fortune telling Hermione asked Just the fortune telling my toenails seem to be just blowing these days Thank you Rachel said proudly Sure darling Hermione replied and grinned What seems to be bothering you Ms Monroe It's Simon the meanest judge in American Idol I can't stop thinking about him I am supposed to participate in the final but I am afraid to panic I'm absolutely obsessed with him I dream about him constantly and I imagine his voice in almost every man I hear To be honest you are the first person I've confided with Do you like vodka Ms Monroe Rachel didn't understand the relevance of the question but she replied nevertheless I'm not crazy about it but I drink a sip now and then Just keep your eyes on the vodka bottle Hermione said as she started to gently caress a tiny vodka bottle which was standing on the table Aren't you supposed to do that with a crystal ball Rachel asked outfully but your trust in Hermione and everything will just fine She took a deep breath and tried not to laugh The next thing she remembered was looking around and feeling like she could really use a good pedicure session When she left Hermione's clinic an hour later she felt worse than she had for ages It was like a nightmare Her face looked pale and she had severe pain in her throat As she strolled down the street she heard a man that sounded exactly like Simon And after another second she realized that she was panicking Feeling stressed she stopped to buy a vodka martini and continued walking home heavy hearted As days went by she noticed that she was thinking about Simon more than ever She was completely terrified of meeting Simon She called her mom and easily persuaded her to come with her to the finals the next day When she arrived at the studios Simon was staring at his feet How are you doing Simon She asked almost losing control over her voice for a moment I am doing great How are you these days Getting by she answered actually thinking about the bottle that she was hiding I have to go to the dressing room Do you need anything He impatiently No I'm fine I was just planning to work on the routine she replied By the way do you have a vodka martini on you by any chance What No He answered looking at her blamfully Rachel felt like a little girl I'm sorry I'll be back in a jiffy she said as she ran to find a hidden spot On her way to the stage while licking what was left of her drink she thought to herself why didn't I go to a regular psychologist first I must never admit this to mom She entered the stage with a blank stare in her eyes I have to see someone about my new focus problem as soon as possible she thought as she started vomiting on her high heel shoes
So I'm 5 000 feet above Albany I'm just a perfect day beautiful blue sky and not a cloud in the sky can see the horizon in every direction When the girl that just pushed me out of the airplane screams wait wait you're shoot It's and she's gone with the plane I don't think the sentence ends functioning properly Have a great jump I think it ends worse I don't know a lot about skydiving but I would think that a working shoot lends to a better jump especially towards the end What happened was I was in my 40s suddenly surprisingly And I did want to be one of those mid life crisis guys who runs out and gets a convertible besides who needs two convertibles And I had already gotten divorced so that was already checked off I needed to do something so I went to cliche number three And I drive upstate to this skydiving academy near Albany for my meeting with Annette the school's bear bellied khaki shorted tan shouldered senior instructors She was 19 years old She was like I could have folded her up and put her my pocket She looked like a lower case eye with a smiley face dot For a head which made me feel a capital O standing next to her But she was professional so the first thing she did was shake my hand but then she put her arm through mine and squeezed it a little bit and said this is going to be awesome And then she led me into the office which looked like I had been kind of delivered on the back of a flatbed truck And like they dropped it on his corner when they unloaded it and inside the office and the first thing she says is that I have pretty eyes And then she hands me the liability waiver It was an extremely Darwinian moment for me because what I should have done was drive away and do something that was more well adapted to doing like driving But I signed it because she told me I had pretty eyes But I wanted her to know that was more than just a pair of pretty eyes that I had the right stuff So I signed it and then she takes me back outside and while the pilot and I don't know his home room teacher are playing hacky sack out on the runway She says we're going to start with the landing because that's the important part And then she folks me the ribs and she says you know it's not the fall that gets you a sudden stop And she giggles because it's a joke Not the funniest joke I've ever heard She kicks over a blue plastic milk crate better foot tall She tells me to hop up and she tells me to jump off of it jump off of it and my feet raise these two little kind of dust clouds like Neil Armstrong And she gives me the thumbs up like I've got the right stuff And then she says we're going to do it I'm going to teach you how to do a drop in roll which is maneuver you do when you land It's where you basically is what it sounds like You drop and you're all the same thing you do if you're on fire And she demonstrates it for me like a Romanian gymnast And she says you know OK you try it now And she helps me back up into the box She says just hop on the bus Gus And I think nice we have something in common you know Her parents or her grandparents were fans of Paul Simon So I get up on the box hold on to her shoulder to steady myself and because I just wanted to hold on to her shoulder And I say I am a rock and I drop like a star And she just giggles adorably and helps me up And as she's picking the graph all out of the palms of my hands she says that's pretty much all there is to it Which would be true if you were teaching me to jump off a milk crate I could have gotten my diploma and just gone home For the next two hours we kind of gradually raise the diving platform the practice platform from this milk crate to a kitchen chair to an aluminum kitchen dinette table to a painter's ladder to 000 feet above sea level Up the plane she shows me this canvas strap which is called the static line attached to the plane And it's attached to my shoot It will open my shoot automatically when it jump out So I won't have to worry about anything And she tugs on it a couple of times to demonstrate that it can withstand the full upper body strength of a teenage girl And then she puts one hand on either of my cheeks leans in close stares in through the fog and my orange goggles that I'm wearing and says listen when I say go you just go don't think She says if you're getting cold feet if you need a little help don't be embarrassed Everybody gets like that I'll just give you a little shove And then she says don't worry I'll be gentle So between the altitude and the pillow talk I am in basically in a love of sick trance and I'll do anything for her I will shoot myself if I think it makes me look brave for her But when I hop out onto the wing and I look down and like pointy steeples and pine trees I get a little cold feet I have some second thoughts in which she goes go I say up but she doesn't hear me And she actually says geronimo and she gives me a shove and I'm gone And I look up and I just see her terrified eyes and that's when I hear her say wait wait your shoot it's And really like the pathetic inadequacy of a two hour skydiving lesson hits home right then I mean it took me longer than that to learn how to knit So I'm heading for the power lines down below me and like reflecting just reflexively squeezing my legs together so that I won't die sliced up the middle I hit a couple of flounder fillets and I'm just like praying my life doesn't flash before my eyes and ruin the last couple of minutes I have LAUGHTER APPLAUSE When suddenly I feel a jolt and I'm yanked around and this big white fluffy beautiful canopy opens above me and I'm floating to earth in dead silence It is really quiet so I can really hear my heart pounding When I get down and I drag all my gear and it's and the straps and the shoots through the onion field back over to the office and that is already their waiting for me and she's holding this plastic cup of the complimentary sparkling wine they talked about and for sure and she's just beaming and I walk up to her and I say what the fuck LAUGHTER You know was that LAUGHTER And she giggles and she says you know you seem like a cruel guy so I wanted you have a really awesome jump So the little parachute malfunction thing was to spike your adrenaline in the last minute LAUGHTER LAUGHTER That's what I said LAUGHTER And so I'm like staring at or trying to think of some language this chick might you know understand You know you have any idea how dangerous how terrifying how illegal that probly was And she says wait wait hey you did it right Before it's too late LAUGHTER LAUGHTER By which she meant at your age So I'm trying to think you know am I going to do this with a knife or just strangle her or be it her to death When my heart starts kind of slowing down and what I just did sort of starts sinking in you know I just like fill out a mile out of the sky on purpose without a shoot for most of it as far as I'm concerned And I dropped and I rolled and I survived And think about the little joke that she told me earlier how it's not the fall that gets you as a sudden stop And I think you know maybe she's right I'm not going to stop That's what kills you And so I lock eyes with her and I glare at I hope I'm cute when I'm angry And I sign up for another lesson LAUGHTER And I drive home with a top down Thank you

I began my illustrious career in journalism in the Bronx where I toiled as a hardballed reporter for the ramp the student newspaper at Fordham University One day I'm walking toward the campus center and out comes the elusive Dean McGowan architect of a policy to replace Fordham's traditionally working to middle class students with wealthier and more prestigious ones So I whip out my notebook and I go up to him and I say Dean McGowan is it true that Fordham University plans to raise tuition substantially above the inflation rate And if so wouldn't that be a betrayal of its mission And he stops and looks at me and he says listen up punk And right then there's a blur in the corner of my eye which becomes this figure holding a cream pie which becomes the guy standing next to me mashing a cream pie into Dean McGowan's face and then runs away And the dean is covered with cream So I give him a moment and then I say Dean McGowan which get a comment on this latest attack And the dean says yes I would care to comment fuck you So I race back to the newsroom with my scoop and I find the editor Jim who's a senior and he will go on to win a Pulitzer Prize that is true And he's a big guy I pitch my story I tell him what I've seen And he says Dean McGowan the guy's a dick right it up So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good And then I start to make it better by adding an element of embellishment Reporters call this making shit up And they recommend against crossing that line But I had just seen the line crossed between a high powered dean and a salt with a pastry And I kind of liked it So the first thing I did was I gave the figure a name I called Pyman capital P capital M And I described him as a Cape wearing masked Avenger Though in fact he'd been capeless And I said that as he fled the scene he clicked his heels and rickish glee And I gave him a catchphrase in Latin I said that he cried out Ego sum non en bistya Which means I am not an animal Which makes no sense I needed something I'm Catholic Latin just comes to me So I finished my story and I handed us Dwyer and he reads and he says Pyman I love it Page one And that's how the first line got crossed A few days later I get a letter It says dear Jim good story nice details If you want to see me again in action be on the steps of Dwayne Library Tuesday at three o'clock Signed Pyman So I was there with a photographer from the RAM And sure enough outcome Sheila Beal student body president And now Sheila was different from me and all the other Fordham students who were flannel shirts and work part time jobs Sheila was well bred Sheila had school spirit Sheila was a kind of student Dean McGowan wanted more of So the rumor had it that he got plenty of her in his office on his desk But that's just a rumor please do not spread that outside this room I myself would never say that But the fact was Sheila had collaborated with the dean to ban outdoor drinking on campus The infamous No More Beer at Barbecue's Rule That's right boo that rule The other thought drinking in public was in poor taste I think you know what happened next Pyman emerged from behind the late night library drop box made his delivery and fled away crying ego sum non al bistya Or at least that's what it said in my story in the newspaper the next day Which ran with a photo of him leaving the scene cape flowing behind him doing this And that's what made him a sensation on campus People started dressing like him and quoting him in class The ram ran five major stories about Pyman all of them by me And towards the end of this one I was at a bar one night and I saw I came in and I saw in the corner Angela from my Britlit class drinking with some friends And now Angela and I had been flirting for two months Or I had been flirting with her And with such nuance that there was a question about whether she knew I existed So I saw her there and made a mental note to do nothing about it And then I went to the bar it's a buy around And I felt a tap on my shoulder and it was her And she said Jim we were just talking about how you always seem to know when and where Pyman will strike And we were wondering are you Pyman And I knew by the way she said it I knew that if I said yes she would have sex with me And wasn't I really Pyman for having brought him into being Didn't she only know about him through me But she had asked me a straightforward question that came with a straightforward answer In fact I wasn't Pyman as far as I knew I had never seen the guy out of costume So I looked at her and I said yes Angela I am Pyman And she said oh good Now buy me a beer and tell me all about it
When the phone rang the grey haired man asked the girl with quite some little deference if she would rather for any reason he didn't answer it The girl heard him as if from a distance and turned her face toward him one eye on the side of the light close tight Her open eye very however disingenuously large and so blue as to appear almost violet The grey haired man asked her to hurry up and she raised up on her right forearm just quickly enough so that the movement didn't quite look perfunctory She cleared her hair back from her forehead with her left hand and said God I don't know I mean what do you think The grey haired man said he didn't see that it made a hell of a lot of difference when we're the other and slipped his left hand under the girl supporting arm Above the elbow working his fingers up making room for them between the warm surfaces of her upper arm and chest wall He reached for the phone with his right hand Hello he said resonantly into the phone The girl stayed propped up on her forearm and watched him Her eyes more just open than alert or speculative reflected chiefly their own size and color A man's voice stone dead yet somehow rudely almost obscenely quickened for the occasion came through at the other end Late did I wake you The grey haired man glanced briefly left at the girl Who's that Yes Arthur Yeah I wake you No no I'm in bed reading Anything wrong The reason I called Leah did you have an a notice when Joni was leaving Did you have an a notice if she left with the Ellen Bogans by any chance The grey haired man looked left again but high this time away from the girl who was now watching him rather like a young blue eyed Irish policeman No I didn't Arthur He said his eyes on the far dim end of the room were the wall met the ceiling And didn't she leave with you No Christ you didn't see her leave it all then Well well no as a matter of fact I didn't Arthur The grey haired man said why What's up Joni lost Oh Christ Who knows I don't know You know her when she gets all tanked up and raring to go I don't know She may have just you're called the Ellen Bogans The grey haired man asked Yeah yeah they're not home yet I know Christ I'm not even sure she left with them I know one thing I know one goddamn thing I'm through beating my brains out I mean it I really meet at this time I threw five years Christ All right all right I try to take it a little easy now Arthur The grey haired man said he turned and gave the girl a sign with two fingers near his mouth that he wanted a cigarette And the first place if I know the Ellen Bogans they probably all hopped in a cab and went down to the village for a couple of hours All three of them will probably barred I have a feeling she went to work on some bastard in the kitchen I just have a feeling She always starts necking some bastard in the kitchen when she gets tanked up I'm through I swear to God I mean it this time Five goddamn where are you now Arthur The grey haired man asked Home He's straightened his back so the girl could reach behind him for the cigarettes Yeah home Home sweet home Christ Look Arthur you want my advice He said absolutely he took his left hand out from between the girl's upper arm and chest wall Getting bad and relaxed Tell the truth Is it going to do you any good to sit around and stew Yeah I know I wouldn't even worry for Christ's sake but you can't trust it I swear to God I swear to God you can't The grey haired man turned his head to see what the girl was doing She had picked up the and was putting it between them You know what I do You know what I do I'm ashamed I'm ashamed to tell you but you know what I very nearly got damn through every night when I get home You want to know Arthur listen this isn't waiting a second I'll tell you God damn it I practically have to keep myself from opening every goddamn closet door in the apartment I swear to God every night I come home I have to expect to find a bunch of bastards hiding all over the place All right All right Let's try to take it a little easier Arthur The grey haired man said he turned his head toward the girl perhaps to show her how forebearing even stoic his confidence was But the girl missed seeing it She had just overturned the airstrahe with her knee and was rapidly with her fingers brushing the spilled ashes into a little pickup pile Her eyes looked up at him The second too late And the first place he said into the phone I told you many many times Arthur that's exactly where you make your biggest mistake You know you do You actually go out of your way to torture yourself As a matter of fact you actually inspired Joni He broke off Your bloody lucky she's a wonderful kid I mean it You give that kid absolutely no credit for having any good taste or brains The Christ thing for that matter Brains Jesus If you knew how funny that was she thinks she's a goddamn intellectual And that's the funny part That's the hilarious part She reads the theatrical page and she watches television till she's practically blind so she's an intellectual You I married to I married to the greatest living undeveloped undiscovered actress novelist psychoanalyst and all around goddamn unappreciated celebrity genius in New York You didn't know that did you Christ it's so funny I could cut my throat In the first place the man said and slowly moved his hand caressed a little lock that rested on the girl's forehead For a halibut intelligent guy you're about as tactless as it's humanly possible to be We're missmated That's all That's a whole simple story We just missmated his hell She doesn't respect me She doesn't even love me for God's sake She brought me a soup once with her own money I tell you about that No the Greyhaired man listened another moment Then abruptly he turned toward the girl The lucky gave her though only glancing fully informed her what was suddenly going on at the other end of the phone Now Arthur listen I say this in an all sincerity Would you get undressed and get into bed like a good guy and relax Junior'll probably be there in about two minutes He listened Arthur you hear me Yeah I hear you Listen I've kept you awake all night anyway Could I come over to your place for a drink Would you mind The man straightened his back and placed the flat of his free hand on the top of his head and said now do you mean Yeah I mean if it's so right with you I'll only stay a minute I just like to sit down somewhere and I don't know Would it be all right Yeah but the point is I don't think you should Arthur The man said lowering his hand from his head I mean you're more than welcome to come but I honestly think you should just sit tight and relax till Johnny waltz is in What you want to be You want to be right there on the spot when when she waltzes in Am I right or not Yeah I don't know I swear to God I don't know Well what I do I honestly do The man said look why don't you hop in bed now and relax And then later if you feel like it give me a ring I mean if you feel like talking And don't worry that's the main thing Hear me Will you do that now All right The man continued for a moment to hold the phone to his ear then lowered it into its cradle What did he say The girl immediately asked him He picked cigarette out of the ash tray that is selected it from an accumulation of smoked and half smoked cigarettes He dragged on it and said you wanted to come over for a drink God what did you say Said the girl You heard me The man said and looked at her You are wonderful Absolutely marvelous The girl said watching him Well the man said it's a tough situation I don't know how marvelous I was You were wonderful The girl said the man looked at her Well it's a very very tough situation The guy's obviously going through absolute the phone suddenly rang The man said Christ but picked it up before the second ring Hello he said into it Lee will you sleep No No Listen I just thought you'd want to know what Jony just botched in What Said the man and bridged his left hand over his eyes though the light was behind him Yes she just botched in about 10 seconds after I spoke to you I just thought I'd give you a ring while she's in the John Listen thanks a million Lee I mean it You wanted to sleep will you No No I was just no No The man said leaving his fingers bridged over his eyes and cleared his throat Yeah What happened was apparently Lee only got stinking and then had a goddamn crying jag and Bob wanted Jony to go out and grab a drink with them somewhere Anyway so she's home What a rat race Honestly God I think it's this God damn New York What I think maybe we'll do it if everything goes along All right We'll get ourselves a little place of Connecticut maybe Not far out necessarily but far enough that we can lead a normal goddamn life I mean she's crazy about plants and all that stuff She'd probably go man if she had a garden If she had her own goddamn garden stuff Know what I mean I mean except you who do we know in New York except a bunch of neurotics It's bound to undermine even a normal person sooner or later Know what I mean Listen Arthur The man interrupted taking his hand away from his face I have a headache I'll listen to that I don't know where I got the blood thing from Yeah you mind if we cut this short I'll talk to the morning all right He listened for another moment then hung up Again the girl immediately spoke to him but he didn't answer her He picked a burning cigarette to the girls out of the ash tray and started to bring it to his mouth but it slipped out of his fingers The girl tried to help him retrieve it before anything was burned but he told her to just sit still for Christ's sake and she pulled back her hand

Let's all go to the lobby Let's all go to the lobby Let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat The of things to eat The popcorn can't be beat The sparkling drinks are just dandy The chocolate bars and the candy So let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat Let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat A small triangle overlapping a smaller circle slides into a rectangle The triangle touches the circle which glides away The triangle slides to it and circle moves away The triangle comes into contact with the circle again and the circle ricochets between the side of the rectangle and the triangle several times The triangle moves in a ring around the circle rotating A large triangle slides towards the rectangle The small triangle slides outside the rectangle until it is adjacent to the large triangle After bouncing both triangles slide out of the scene The rectangle reassembles into a square like structure with a triangular top and a line in the middle The triangle slides into the structure through a gap in the bottom The triangle 90 degrees The small triangle slides diagonally to the upper right stopping at the middle line The large triangle does the same The rotate so their top corners touch And then the small triangle rotates so the top corner points up The large triangle slides diagonally down and rotates in place Both triangles move slightly up and down up and down The top of the structure rotates open and small triangle moves slowly upwards while rotating The structure turns into a large V The branches of the V rotate up and down The V splits into two smaller Vs and the triangle moves left and right with the Vs Again the two Vs split in half making four Vs The four Vs move in the same direction as the triangle which moves left and right The Vs reform the original square like structure The big triangle appears triangles move slightly up and down The big triangle moves diagonally up to the middle line A adjacent to the little triangle it moves up and down once The large triangle moves diagonally down The small triangle does the same The small triangle slides down out of the structure The large triangle disappears and the entire structure rotates 360 degrees The large triangle appears at the bottom The small triangle moves into the structure moves up and down next to the large triangle once and then slides diagonally up to the middle of the structure The small triangle rotates 90 degrees and then bounce slowly in place The structure's lower pieces form four Vs that again move up and down The small triangle moves upward The Vs are positioned around the triangle moving with it The Vs become rigid and form separate bars Other pieces form four longer lines The line on the left as hinges and moves towards the triangle The triangle moves to the upper right where the lines move down The lines then move vertically extending towards the triangle The moving lines reform the square like structure and the small triangle moves down to the middle line The large triangle appears moves left and then rotates to point diagonally up The small triangle rotates 90 degrees and slides diagonally down Both bounce and the little triangle exits the structure The large triangle disappears and the structure rotates 360 degrees The large triangle appears The small triangle slides into the structure bounces adjacent to the large triangle and diagonally upwards towards the middle line It rotates until it points up as does the large triangle below Both bulbs slightly up and down The top of the square like structure opens and the small triangle moves upwards The square forms six lines two half moving parts The lines move sideways altogether and a long line with hinges swings out towards the triangle The triangle moves downwards The small square appears from the left Two of the lines rotate to point at them The square and the triangle move counterclockwise around the screen The square and triangle move up and down The square leaves and re enters with a small circle The circle is between the triangle and square The circle moves quickly towards the lines When the circle touches the lines they collapse into pieces The triangle moves above the pieces making a small loop And then glides off the screen The pieces are stationary The triangle reappears from the bottom left of the screen The top of the triangle touches one of the pieces which rotates up and back down The motion is repeated on another piece and the triangle touches the circle underneath it The circle and triangle moving in sync move up and make a full revolution The triangle moves off screen while the circle and the pieces are stationary The pieces reform the square like structure The small triangle moves slowly into it from the top The large triangle appears in the bottom moves left and bounces once The small triangle rotates 90 degrees diagonally down and bounces next to the large triangle It slides out of the structure The structure reconfigures into a rectangle with a gap in the upper left side and a circle in the bottom left The small triangle slides through the gap It touches the angled bar which rotates to close the gap The triangle slides towards the circle of the triangle Until are touching the circle moves upward and stops The triangle moves towards the circle and the circle moves away A square appears on the left and moves towards the rectangle The square stops It touches the bar which rotates to make a gap It moves to the triangle's position The shapes touch and then bounce adjacent to each other The triangle moves to the circle the circle moves to the square The circle moves repeatedly between the square and the triangle
Let's all go to the lobby let's all go to the lobby Let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat The less you'll think to eat The popcorn can't be beat The sparkling drinks are just dandy The

The boy kicks the ball and then dashes after it He lines up his shot and kicks the ball again The boy catches up to the ball and bounces it off the playgrounds fences several times Passing it to himself As he circles the ball lining up his next shot His father shows up and calls for him The boy takes one final kick at the ball before leaving the playground to meet his waiting father The boy his father exchange a few words and leave The boy his father live in a modest two story home with a pointed roof After arriving home they have a short chat and the boy turns and climbs the stairs to his second floor bedroom His father follows gives his son a good night kiss and tucks him in for the night While the boy falls asleep his father walks back downstairs to his bedroom on the first floor Climes into bed and quickly falls asleep Upstairs the boy begins to dream The ceiling opens up and he floats into the sky along with a huge bird Higher above mountains the boy can fly The giant bird splits into two smaller birds which soar across the sky with the boy The two birds become four birds The boy plays with the birds but then the flock gangs up on him and starts chasing him He tries to fly away but cannot escape Thankfully the dream ends and the birds disappear The boy sleeps peacefully for the rest of the night In the morning the boy's father climbs the stairs to his son's bedroom and wakes him up The boy follows his father bound the stairs to the first floor of their home They have a brief conversation before the boy heads out for the day The day passes The father waits for his son to return home When he does the two talk briefly The boy climbs into bed as does his father downstairs both fall right asleep Shortly after falling the boy starts to have the bird dream again The four birds from the previous night are back They surround him preventing him from escaping no matter which direction he turns The birds transform into a giant monster with two long arms and two wobbly legs The monster swatts the boy He misses and tries again Frightened the boy flies over the monster evading its grasp The monster scrunches into a little ball It bounces lunging at the boy After the boy dodges this attack the nightmare finally ends The boy sleeps peacefully for the rest of the night In the morning the boy's dad wakes up walks to the stairs and shouts for his son to come down The boy jumps up and goes down the stairs After a brief good morning the boy again heads out for the day and the day passes At the end of the day the boy returns home Greets his father quickly and then goes straight upstairs to his bedroom The boy climbs into bed as does his father downstairs Both eventually fall asleep But the third night in a row the boy begins to dream The towering monster from the previous dream appears again slowly following the boy and reaching for him with one arm The boy stays out of his reach and hovers uncertainly around the monster's feet Suddenly he is joined by another boy The feet frantically as the monster reaches down the boy's fly over the monster which is still clawing at them The boy's make a desperate plan and the new boy speeds away He quickly returns with ball The boy's put the ball in a slingshot the last minute they let it go shooting the ball into the monster which breaks into a heap excited The boy swoops over the heap Until he notices that the other boy is gone He goes looking for his new friend but can't find him He checks under the rubble for his friend He finds the ball but not the other boy His friend is nowhere to be seen Disappointed the boy abandons the ball and slowly leaves the dream He sleeps the rest of the night In the morning the boy's father wakes up and calls for him from the bottom of the stairs The boy wakes up gets out of bed and walks downstairs Father and son exchange a few words and the boy heads out The boy walks to the playground where his ball is still sitting at the far end of the yard The boy enters the playground and closes the gate after himself He forerunally walks to the single ball He slowly and unenthusiastically kicks the ball halfway down the yard As he kicks the ball again his mysterious friend from the dream appears and sneaks towards the playground He checks that his friend is there he quietly opens the gate He sneaks up on the boy who still doesn't see him he taps the boy on the shoulder The boy whirls around the two friends talk back and forth The boy races to get his ball as his friend gets in position The boy kicks the ball to his friend who quickly passes it back playing together in real life just as they had in the dream
Music Okay so they began with like a dream sequence of a shootout It's during the day It looks like in some sort of the shovel like half decomposed building There's a lot of guys in our make ear shooting It's very chaotic You can't really make out any faces or really people And so that cuts out really quickly and man of like start out of the bed and start It looks like it's in the middle of the night or something And so he just kind of sits up there keeping for a while like he just woke up on the night air which is what we that dream was So then it cuts out to the haytime get like his apartment and he's like walking around They have a shot of his mug which has some kind of like sign on it like a crest almost And then there's like a quick shot too of like a gun and a notebook And then it cuts to another clip of the same man sitting in front of what we can assume this is therapist And they're talking she says something still having fresh issues and or no She writes that and then he reads it upside down and asks her like about writing that and then she confronts him about reading her writing upside down and a very tense situation And then that immediately cuts out and we see a blind woman in an office building She's on the phone with man and we're not sure what the relationship is between her the man But she tells get a taxi home And then right after we see a clip of a man taking a pill out of this clear bottle and the pill is white with red dots on it And the scene is so you're not exactly sure what's happening He looks like in some sort of building though like where I'm against the edge and like a glass elevator or some small confined area So he's shaking he takes his pill and then we see him press against the glass from an outside perspective The leader revealed that he died and it's a that that pill the poison that killed him And then there's a quick scene where someone who was was a good person We're not sure why he died or I mean why he would have committed suicide And then the blood woman who spoke to him on the phone earlier in the background crying And then we cut to another scene of these two teenagers maybe early 20s guys pretty young walking in the rain One of them doesn't have his umbrella and the other does and it's raining and it's dark it's evening The one without the umbrella tells his friend I'm going to go back and get my umbrella the training And then so he leaves and again it's kind of unclear exactly what happens but the friend is waiting for a while We can assume that because he checks his wash And then the guy the same bottle that the man had earlier with in it got a pierce getaway Assume that the guy who walked away supposedly to get an umbrella took the spill and then died then there is another scene with two it looks like it's in a club or something there's a bar A woman walks out of the club dance floor area and a man hey she's still dancing if you can call it that And then these two are actually that's just getting that's the end of those two characters And then we see the woman assuming she's the one that those two characters are talking about And she also has these pills and takes what out of the same file again and it's dead We then go to a panel It's like a press conference and we're not sure exactly who the characters are on the panel but they seem to of public safety police chief kind of figures And there's pictures of the three suicide victims as a backdrop There's a man who are really speaking or who are important to see and the man talking He's saying things like these suicides are definitely linked It was the same poison that all of them He does say something so he says I believe we have our on the team and that everyone in the room gets a text that just says wrong a wrong or exclamation mark And then later he says oh later there's woman in the audience who asks if these suicides are linked how do we know they're not murder And then the man responds saying well they're obviously suicides It was the man or the pills are obviously self administered And then he says like in short or woman asks like how can we prevent this from happening He almost brushes his off saying well don't commit suicide And then he says something along the lines of a paraphrasing but you guys everyone is as safe as they want to be And then again the everyone text saying wrong and that's the third time that that text is said And then a text is said to only the man who is speaking Oh I'm not sure if I remember when it said but it was signed SH which we can assume is Sherlock Holmes Let's see and then I believe we go to go back to Watson which was the man who had the nightmare earlier And he's walking around what looks like a university area He meets this other guy I'm not exactly sure what his real unit but this older man and they sit and talk for a while they're having a copy Oh I never mentioned earlier but so Watson he has a his leg is injured so he walks with the cane and with a bit of a lip But yeah so this man that he met are now sitting on a bench just talking There's another scene where we see Sherlock the seed opens with the camera as if the camera was a canaver So the camera is like looking up and walks in unzips this the the bag and then is looking out of the camera And that's when you Sherlock unzips it looks down that's when we first see him And he other this other lady with him assuming or I've been to refuse the assistant And so we him take like not sure what it's called like one of those cattle things like wax this body pretty furiously for quite a while He says something about like checking how the bruises form to his assistant and then she starts to ask for coffee He interrupts her saying that she had put on lipstick she looks embarrassed but then ends up finishing asking if you want coffee And he says yes he goes up to his lab where he's working on something and looks like a pipe pet or something to walk a fluid He delivers to him his coffee and he makes a remark that she now has a move lipstick and she again looks kind of embarrassed as something about it not working out for her And he said something like it wasn't improvement or something your lips look small now Well this is happening he had just met Watson so Watson and his friend from earlier approached Sherlock in his lab and maybe one of the first things Sherlock says to Watson is so what was it Iraq or Afghanistan so he immediately knows that Watson was an army doctor He made so much of that later also saying like I know your army doctor We have revealed that Sherlock is looking for a flat meat and this mutual friend is now going to introduce Watson to Sherlock and hopes that Sherlock and Watson will be a suitable roommate for Watson So that happens Sherlock asks for the mutual friend's phone and he doesn't have it so Watson offers a quiz Sherlock said the text or something through his phone and then before those two leave meeting Watson and his friend Sherlock says meat meat at this address to to why the papers I think that's where his flat is going to be and then Watson kind of says something along lines of we don't even know each other and Sherlock starts listing things he says So Watson was an army doctor in Afghanistan and that he's not close to his brother His brother recently walked out of a bear or something or is it alcoholic or both and Watson looks very or shocked I guess at this So I believe we see of them now and they are entering what we can Sherlock's flat There's another lady the landlord forgot her name but she's also there with him in the principal We see that Sherlock's flat is a complete mess There's books things there's a skull poster the wall there's another actual skull sitting above the fireplace the a mess there's lots of like chemistry lab equipment on there But yeah so then they go into there and they talk for a little bit Sherlock he makes some comments about to his land lady about having her make and tear clean up the kitchen or something along those lines and she kind of for that saying I'm not like a housekeeper I'm the landlord here but I'm not sure if he's a police car or just immediately know that that means that there has been another suicide Oh yeah so before the scene there's another one of those like unclear fuzzy suicide teams or we see a woman with bright red nails reaching for yet again that same pill bottle with in it and then so we can assume that she could be the suicide of the So back to the Sherlock that he's looking at the window he says this time it's unusual though number four is different so not long after he there's a man who comes up the stairs up to Sherlock's flat I'll call him like the investor police investigator from here and out for clarity sake so the police man He doesn't even say anything to Sherlock it up like the first Sherlock says like like what's different about this case and then he asks why like what do you think Sherlock says well if there wasn't anything different you would have come the something along those lines and then the man says they you don't have they never leave a note they left it out So he leaves after or no he asks Sherlock will you come and then Sherlock kind of not showing he says like I'll be a hug behind you and then the police man leaves Sherlock is suddenly like first out really excited he says so much fun and quickly goes after him So now the flat there's just the land lady and Watson left and then Watson asked for and biscuits and the land lady him what she said earlier Sherlock about not picking a housekeeper Sherlock now reappears really quickly and then there's like a witty exchange between him and Watson and Sherlock says you're a doctor I'm sure you've of like gruesome violent things and then Watson says yeah like more than enough more than what he wants to see more and then Watson replies appropriately and those two go to the scene of the crime The way they're they have a conversation in the cab where Watson asks Sherlock how you everything about having like an extreme a strange brother who left his wife and or is alcoholic and how he knew that was an army doctor from Afghanistan So Sherlock explains everything I didn't catch every little detail he said but even though like he says the way that Watson walked the scratches on his phone the back then was handed down and then engraving on the back phone So Watson is very thoroughly oppressed and Sherlock is almost surprised by that the most people get angry and then as they're leaving the cab Watson or Sherlock asks Watson what he got wrong and then Watson up everything exactly as Sherlock said it and Sherlock was wasn't surprised like wow well what's it got everything right and then Watson says well Harry is short for Harry yet So Sherlock was actually wrong about the gender of Watson so wasn't his brother assistant So they arrived at night there's police cars the sirens it looks like a pretty old right a part for building The two are greeted by this lady she's wearing like a pico to the skirt and then there's some animosity between this lady and Sherlock It seems like they've some history of some they don't like each other she calls up the freak and Yeah there's a good tense in there he asks why he makes a comment about her not having come home last night and still wear the same thing for the night before And so it took under there's this guy named Anderson who comes out who we know does not get a lot to all the Sherlock maybe does a play believe in his abilities detective abilities so Anderson or says to some snorkey things to him what and Sherlock makes a comment about the lady spending the night with Anderson because of the colloquial he something and then also makes a comment about her knees applying that like there are some sexual relationships going on And so he need Sherlock and Watson enter the
This is the story of my first landlord my first department in New York I think I'm going to call it rent I first came up here from South Carolina like apparently or North Carolina like everybody in this on the stage tonight back in the early 80s And I was living on people's floors and I was trying to find an apartment And I don't know if you'll remember what it was like to get an apartment in 1981 Some of you may not but it was required that you sort of commit a crime There was all sorts of sort of sub leases and various shady documents that had to be many a graft and like Cuba and then sent back And there was this thing called key money Does anybody remember that Key money Maybe that's still around I don't know Anyway a friend of mine called me up and said I think I've got a place for you It's in my building You have to go talk to the superintendent His name is Bulb And I said okay well what do I need to bring And he said you know basically 550 and then envelope So I showed up and went into the super's office and there was Bob And we started talking and I said well here's the key money and I just popped it on the desk And I guess I didn't know the protocol of sleasing an apartment in New York I guess you weren't supposed to put the key money right there in front of the superintendent But I seem to have offended him By the way my friend Kevin when he warned me about going in there he said Bob talks a little differently than other people So just stay on your toes So the key money on the table Bob kind of fixed an eye on me He says let me tell you something mister One of those reporters came in here one time asking me if I would run an apartment you know like this And I could tell he had a device in his lapel And I leaned right over in his lapel and I said let me tell you something buster I rent my apartments to anybody I want to And I said it so loud that the guy in the soundtrack out front came busting out the back of the car blood gushing out of his ears and ran off down the street So I kind of looked at Bob and said wow that must have been quite a scream you made there And he kind of looked at me And then I think I got a lease I'm not sure I lived there for 10 years I think I had a lease And Bob and I Bob was the superintendent for four buildings on West 99th Street And over the years I got to learn just how this guy talked It was not it was just the way he described reality It was all very different than maybe the one we all share here on this time space continuum So for example one time he was fixing something in the hall and he just offhandedly told me that he owned five ranches in Brazil where he was from And two vineyards in Italy I said wow Bob I mean so why are you fixing my toilet then I don't know And Bob said well you the stress of the ranches hurt my heart And my doctor in Brazil said grow more flesh to protect the heart And Bob in fact had grown quite an ample carapace of flesh to protect his heart He would tell you like you know in my country I can kill somebody and get away with it because it's written into the Constitution that you can't prosecute me Okay Well that must be very handy somehow And then there was my landlord The landlord his name was Alan Stern He only showed up about once a week And he was fairly reasonable you know like there was a co op attempt This was a big thing in the 80s Everybody thought we were going to get rich Both the landlords and the tenants all thought we were going to get super rich And I cooperated with Alan and we tried to work this thing out He was going to co op the building He'd make him pile of money We'd buy our apartments for cheap and then cash out and make tons of money and be happy Well it turns out the city sent an engineer up there the report on our building said something like a column of dust held up by 125 years of paint That's literally a quote from the engineer's report And I sort of knew that because whenever I went to hammer a nail into the wall to hang a picture you know that feeling of like maybe I'm holding that picture Maybe I'll tape up a poster over that large hole that I've just not made in the wall there But Alan and I also had our differences The apartment was split between the yuppie scum like myself who had moved in with new jobs and a little bit of money And then these older Puerto Rican grandmothers who lived in the building who had much lower rents from way back when And Alan wanted to make more money so he was not doing anything for the old ladies and he was giving us all the services you know which was Bob of course Bob would in and fix your toilet and make it worse But of course what Alan didn't understand is that I'm a southern guy And one thing you know a southern guy with an eight year perfect attendance pin from Sunday school does really really well is old lady management So of course I knew or got to know every one of these old ladies and became their friend And at one point one of them showed me her apartment and I was like what is your tub doing standing with all this water Why are your chons not fixed So I started a rent strike on behalf of these ladies and Alan and I got had very harsh words But it was all very gentlemanly He said he was going to take me to court and sue me because I had nothing to sue him for and I said Alan you know we're all going to go to court This could be all these nice grannies and they're going to be complaining and then you're going to be saying that you do all the services for all of us We look very different from the grannies and this is going to be in front of a judge And so you're going to lose And Alan it took a while Alan wasn't a rocket scientist but Alan figured out that he was in fact going to lose him and everything was all damn muckablay Meanwhile there was Bob Bob one time I remember we had these funny lamps in the kitchen Those round like fluorescent things you know they worked for like five years and then finally mine went out They were also in the hall of this building and I went to Bob and I said Bob you know those funny round lamps in the hall Mine's burnt out I'm just you know do I buy those or I mean do you have them I mean where do I I don't even know where to get one of those you know And he goes let me tell you something Mr Don't try to steal the lamps in the hall I have put a device in there If you take the bulb out it will explode the glass shoot it in your eyes and you will be blind So I took this to me that I was to buy the lamp because I had finally mastered Bob ness you know So I lived in this apartment for 10 years up into the early 90s And one day I was walking to work and I hadn't seen Bob or Alan for a couple of days There was another superintendent the only one that was worth ever talking to Smitty And the only one who could fix anything And nobody seemed to be around There were four buildings that were all owned by the same little group there And was walking to work and I saw that you know the Daily News had another headline that said Terror landlord in New York I thought oh that sounds good I walked over looked at it like that's my landlord It's Alan Stern Terror landlord That's my guy And I picked up the paper I sat down and read the stories unbelievable Alan had gotten so Alan his sister by the way the stories trip Alan his sister owned the four buildings And so each of them basically had two So the sister's husband was divorcing her And under the New York rules he would get half the family assets which would be one of these four buildings Which were worths even though there were six stories of columns of dust held up 125 years of paint As you know that's still worth a lot of money in New York City So Alan did not want to part with one of his six stories of dust held up years of paint that easily So he had the guy killed And Bob apparently had found the hitman and contract and they had killed this guy Like a long time ago like when I was living in the building you know like 1984 or something They killed they had this guy shot You know one of those stories of like the guy's found dead under a bridge It was down in the village He was found on the west side highway And they thought he'd just been mugged you know while I've been taken or something like that And so lo and behold all of a sudden you know Alan was gone He got life He went to prison forever And Bob had ratted him out And Bob still lived in our building I would see him It's like unbelievable you know And then after a couple of years Bob just sort of disappeared And the story just went away We all just stunned And so and eventually I got married and moved out of the city and I live in New Haven Connecticut And I worked for the New York Times And I was working on a story one time about money laundering on a little island called Naru It's in the Pacific Ocean And I'd called this assistant secretary of the treasury who was in charge of investigating complicated financial things His name is John Moscow a great name or what And he actually is exactly the name that you think He picked up the phone John Moscow I was like I'm Jack Hid blah blah blah New York Times calling me a money laundering So you know in that first moment of calling somebody for an interview you know you of chat him up a little bit So we were just talking I said if you don't been doing lots of financial crime you no no I used to do homicide in York homicide I was like oh well I said yeah back in the glory days you before Dinkins and Giuliani you know stopped crime before that happened it was actually like this crime wave under the rule of ed Koch you know 2000 people a year or something And I said oh yeah the glory days of New York I remember Yeah you know I was actually sort of involved in one of those So I had a you know landlord who was had his brother in law killed and you know and he got put away because Alan Stern 206 West 99th Street I'm like yeah he goes I'm the one who put him away I couldn't believe it What are the odds you know I call all the DAs in the world to get this guy So we start chatting It's like unbelievable And he says you know yeah you know they you know Bob had turned states witness He called that number 555 tips you know that crime number That's how he turned Alan in So I said man you know Bob what a nut that guy was I said you know he just the most incompetent guy ever You know he just every time he you know every time he'd fix anything one time he went to fix one of my sinks and and put so much of that drain oh like fluid in there literally blew the whole sink off the wall And I had to move out of the apartment for a week to get the sludge out And and I said you know he used to always how did you deal with him You would always come up with these crazy stories you know tell us like you know well you know I'm in the constitution I can't be you know charged with murder in Brazil Mosque says yeah that one's kind of true I'm like what Because yeah that's this and truth there I said what are you talking about He goes well you have to understand Bob DeSalvo was a member of the Brazilian secret police And he killed people A lot of people And he we think cuts him deal with the government and moved to New York and became your super No way Way And I went and looked it up I went and looked the trial you know And at one point in the trial he's asked about he's asked about what he did in Brazil And he said I tortured people My specialty was men Oh my God you know And so then Mosque finally explains the whole story which is essentially that Alan having killed his brother in law wanted to rub out a couple of troublemakers in the building Right He wanted Bob to go higher The same killers to kill these tenant activists because they were causing him all this trouble And Bob realized he says you can't do that You know be the first suspect You know you can't do it And he says well I'm going to do it If you don't do it I'm going to do it And Bob thinking like a good secret police torturer realized that if he didn't rat Alan out he was going to get caught And then Bob was going to get implicated in the earlier killing So Bob called 555 Tips and turned it in And so John Mosque I was telling me this I'm going John I'm the tenant activist That's me I'm one of them anyway So Bob DeSalvo my crazy superintendent may actually have saved my life I'm Well when I was about 13 years old I also went to the doctor And the doctor told me said you know your eyesight's getting bad I'm afraid you're going to need either glasses or contacts for the rest of your life You know that's not terribly unusual But he went on to say you know I hate to be the one to break it to you But you're no longer eligible to be a NASA astronaut And that might seem like an unusual thing for your doctor to say But in my case it wasn't that unusual because my doctor was the NASA doctor Which is because my father was astronaut In fact my neighbor's raw astronauts My right hand neighbor was again a man named Joe Engel who was another shuttle astronaut Left hand neighbor Hoot Gibson another astronaut You know nearby people like Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong lived you know relatively nearby And all my neighbors who weren't astronauts were either scientists or engineers usually for NASA or a prime contractor involved in putting people in the space And so when I was told that I was no longer eligible that was like being told that you are no longer welcome in the club that your father your neighbors and all your friends are a member of And while before that moment I probably would have never said you know when I grew up I want to be an astronaut because I just assumed everybody went space because everybody I knew did go to space But suddenly I you know I said look you know if I can't go that's clearly disappointing I was angry and you know as depressed as a 13 can get you know which isn't that depressed really But within a couple of days I resolved myself to the following thought I said you know if I'm not welcome in the community of NASA astronauts you know who are they to be the gatekeepers to space If I can't go as an astronaut I'm just going to have to bring into existence a civilian spaceflight capability And at the age of 13 that of course doesn't sound nearly as impossible as I'm sure you understand that it really proved to be But of course also the age of 13 not really prepared to begin pursuing it with vigor So you know even though that was became my goal in life I did more normal things that a teenager would do But in my neighborhood normal was still a little different For example you know my father when he would come home from work at NASA he would go into his study until the late night And when he did emerge in the evenings he usually brought out with him into the living room some of the techno toys or experiments he was working on for spaceflight which were usually things that while they seemed normal to me were science or technology that was you know decades ahead of when other people and other neighborhoods would ever get to see it For example one of the toys he brought home one time was something called a photo multiplier too A little kind of cylinder of aluminum that we put a camera lens on one end and a telescope ocular on the other end And you could use it to go out the middle of the night and hunt the cat in the backyard at midnight And of course this actually became the basis of what a decade later became night vision scopes But know that word didn't even exist when we were playing with it in the backyard And there was just one of many you know such experiences But when I entered high school I had another kind of pivotal life moment I had my sister in law gave me a book The Lord of the Rings And that same year a game called Dungeons and Dragons was published And that's also the first year that personal computers came into existence And I actually fell in love with all three of those And so in the early 70s or mid 70s I became one of the very first ever people ever to begin to write computer programs and games on personal computers And was funny about the school went to is we had one computer terminal back in the 70s But there was no class it no teacher knew how to use it there was no curriculum for it But I fell in love with it And since I was an active student of science at the time I competed in science fairs and things you know throughout my tenure in school So the faculty knew that I was a self starter and could do independent projects So they let me have my own classroom no teacher no curriculum to turn in All I to do was show them what I did by the end of the semester which was usually make some games And they gave me a guaranteed premium A credit which was mighty convenient for me But they had to count it as something that had of classify this class And so for four years while I was teaching myself at a program games they counted it as my foreign language credit So I actually never took a foreign language in school And by the time my entered college another kind of interesting thing occurred You know which is that I don't forget up until now I'd lived within this little NASA enclave And when I went to school or went to college when to college I met what I used to call the Sesame Street people You know the butcher the baker the policeman the fireman All these things that I thought was a fantasy on television I now learn was actually real normal life And my little sheltered existence was what was abnormal And another kind of thing happened at that time too which was I began to publish my first games I wrote a series of games called Ultima It was one of the very first ever and longest running you know fantasy role playing series that existed And as my income level began to skyrocket my grade point average began to crash And I knew that there was a real problem that came up when I flunked my first programming class And programming is what I was doing all night every night you know by myself at home So I clearly knew the material but just wasn't interested in the class And so I contemplated dropping out of school And you know for me this would be a pretty tough decision because every other member of my family has advanced degrees and they're things like astronauts And here I was considering dropping out of school to go play games for a living which is what I did But the side effect that was that with the income that I was getting out of these games that allowed me to begin to pursue my passion of exploration And I went down to the sea floor I've been down to the Titanic been at a high end thermal events I've been on safaris in Africa I've dug out canoeed the Amazon I've been on meteorite hunts down in Antarctica But of course space was always the thing that I really had this passion for And I had made many investments down through my entire gaming career most of which never went very far towards the privatization of space But finally right about the end of the right about 2000 started a series of companies that cracked the door open The first one was called the X Prize where we paid a 10 million prize for the first private vehicle to floof twice to space We started a company called Zero G Corp that actually has a 727 we fly people in parabolic flights So for example all of you can go do that great fun by the way But we started a company called Space Adventures And with my money Space Adventures went over to Russia and negotiated a contract with the Russians to be able to fly civilians on the Russian Soyuz to the International Space Station And right when I sold my first game company origin I had the money I arranged the ticket I was going to become the first private citizen to ever fly into space Then came the 2001 internet stock market crash and with it went all of my wealth And so not only did I have to stop construction on a home that I've still never finished but I had to sell my seat to space I spent 25 years in pursuit of I sold off to a man named Dennis Tito who became the first private citizen in space Very sad day for me But then I went back and I said okay I know what to I know how to make games so I went back and started another game company built some more games sold some more games And as soon as I had enough money to pay for a ticket to space first thing I did with all the wealth I generated today was I plunked down my deposits my non refundable deposits on my trip to space But just because you want to go just because you've arranged the business to be able to go just because you've paid to go doesn't mean they will let you go There's one more major hurdle which is medical exams And to go in space which is challenging physiologically they study your body in great detail And when they did this on me they found something fairly alarming they found something called a homangioma on my liver And in this case in the case of rapid depressurization of spacecraft it would represent an increased chance of internal bleeding which you could neither diagnose nor cure and therefore it be fatal And so they said Richard you can't go to space with that So you either have to give up your large deposits you've already made now to go to space or you have to undergo life threatening surgery So what you think I did I now have a 16 inch scar as a memento of my quest to find my way into space And so finally after that hurdle was passed I finally began my training in Russia spent about a year in Russia in preparations Then finally escorted by my father I actually went out on October 12th 2008 Columbus Day a good day to go exploring But on my own custom made space suit walked out to a fully fueled rocket It's covered in frost because of all the cradginic fuel on board and all the air coming nearby it is condensing into fog that's streaming down to the fire pit down below it And then while everybody else gets as far away as they can me and my two crewmates crawled up inside squeezed inside this very claustrophobic little capsule went through a brief checklist lit that sucker up and then took the very brief eight and a half minute ride from standing still on the ground to traveling around the earth at 000 miles an hour At that speed you orbit the earth once every 90 minutes You see a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes You cross the entire United States in only eight minutes You go around the world 16 times every day and I spent 12 days floating around all day and all night like Superman performing experiments and looking back on the earth until finally the fiery reentry the impact back on the surface where my father was again waiting for me to win the rescue helicopter So it was kind of a very cool you know father son moment for us And my father was actually influential in another way You know he since he had experience in flying windspace before he helped me put together my entire science program And he knew that one of the most important things to get the chance to do while you're in space is to be at the window and look back at the earth And so we planned lots of experiments where I'd be at the window and got a chance to look back the earth And there's something called the overview effect that most every astronaut describes which is really this series of epiphanies that you get from this great wonderful vantage point you have in space looking back the earth For example as soon as I saw a place on the earth that I knew well in my case he was Houston Austin Dallas and the Gulf Coast and the entire planet I immediately said you know I now know the true scale of the earth by direct observation And that actually means a lot more to you personally when it happens than it even does to hear it be said But then as you go around the earth over and over again just by looking out the window your knowledge about the what I call the grand scale systems the earth goes up very rapidly things like weather the results of tectonic plate movement the water erosion by water erosion by wind all these things you know just pouring into your brain at 17 miles an hour But the most impactful thing doesn't happen until you've been looking out the window for a few days which is that every part of the earth you can see from space every fertile part of the earth you can see from space is fully occupied by people There was no fertile part of the earth that I saw that wasn't either a city or a farm Only things like Alpine mountains or vast deserts or really swampy parts of the earth weren't fully occupied by people And it really inspires you to come back to the earth afterwards and kind of redouble your efforts towards environmentalism you might say broadly You know I would have described myself as an environmentalist before I flew but my lifestyle has been changed profoundly since I've flown But you know of all the experiments that space which on another time I'm happy to recount more tales of of course the most ironic is that you know no NASA astronaut who's flown in space has ever flown who's had laser eye surgery which in the intervening years I have had And so the one thing that NASA would have blocked me from ever flying into space for became the number one thing they were interested in studying about me as I prepared for my space flight And so I submitted to and participated in a very extensive test a of tests on my eyes And since my flight NASA has now approved for all astronaut candidates laser corrective eye surgery So the thing that NASA of course you know banned me for has kind of become my one contribution back to the fold So thank you
Tonight a story by Frederick Paul tunnel under the world On the morning of June 15 Guy Berkhardt woke up screaming It was more real than any dream he ever had in his life He could still hear and feel that sharp metal ripping explosion that searing wave of heat He sat up Mary Mary Mary Where are you Guy what's wrong You're Where were you the kitchen cooking breakfast What is it I don't know a dream I guess An explosion Did you say an explosion Yes But that's the dream I had What I dreamed there was a big explosion and then something sort of hit me on the head Oh he smokes me Maybe there really was some sort of explosion started a streaming Well there'll be an explosion down at your office if you don't hurry and get to work Coming in on the bus Berkhardt watched to see if there was any evidence of an explosion There wasn't If anything the town looked better than ever The only thing that seemed strange to him was fact that none of the usual crowd was on the bus He was a little relieved when his old pal Henry Swanson finally got on Excuse me Not Henry Pardon me sir what's the matter with you It's me Guy Berkhardt Berkhardt Sorry I don't believe we've met What Henry for Pete's sake it's me If you'll excuse me this is my stop Well I'll be I'll be like that Guy Berkhardt got off in front gigantic control chemical building took the elevator to the 98th floor where he had worked in accounting department for 12 years It wasn't until he was almost at his floor that he realized the speaker was not playing the usual commercial Friends are you happy with your present home freezer of Carstnad Well the answer to problems is a fecal freezer The fecal freezes are better freezes Most wise we'll do anything freezer Friends are you happy with your present home freezer Morning Miss Horn Well you're here do I see you Why you like it makes a lot of difference in your appearance And Mr Bothin No He had an appointment with Mr Dorchon the Human Research Institute Today But today is the of June You have to sign quarterly statement You wouldn't be in Huh that's mighty peculiar Yes sir Oh by the way Miss Horn what the devil is a fecal freezer freezer There's some new copy on the elevator commercial Dorchon must have landed in another account freezes I really don't know Mr Berkhardt It's a funny day Can't quite put my finger on it but there's something strange going on He couldn't shake the thought out of his mind He persisted all through the day and through dinner He was still brooding as he Mary got ready for bed Yeah I do Oh well no Anything wrong I Well I guess I'll get a good night's sleep Coming I think I'll sit up and read for a while Well good night At exactly midnight Guy Berkhardt lapsed into a sudden deep sleep And the following morning he woke up screaming Darling what is it What's wrong Oh I think they dream I guess gave me such a shock I seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately Really Yes the one I had yesterday This was the same Big explosion and then nothing You had a dream yesterday Well of course I did You the same sort of dream I Guy your mistake and I don't remember dreaming Oh no Mary told me Guy your mistake and Mary maybe you dreamed I had a dream Maybe Yes I might done that I suppose Everything did seem sort of strange that's probably it You better get dressed here today's 15th That's when the quarterly 15th Yes Well must have been a dream because yesterday was 15th Berkhardt got up dressed ate breakfast and took the usual bus to work Once again everything seemed even brighter and newer than usual And once again he was puzzled when he noticed none of the old crowd on the bus Pardon me please Oh look don't shove so Oh morning Henry Morning But God say don't talk to me What is it you being followed as a I don't know Well I will show you remember You I can't talk And this is my excuse me please Well Henry Henry for pizza As in yesterday's dream Guy Berkhardt got off at his stop at The Elevator to the 98th floor The speaker in the elevator heard a new commercial this time Marlin C R E K There's Santa time Does your present C make your throat feel raspy unpleasant Marlin C contained in a reckless new drug which actually gives you the sensation of smooth creamy smoke Marlin He walked down the marble corridor to his office Good Berkhardt Good morning Miss Horn Do you like my new hairdo Uh yes Mr in No sir He had no appointment with Mr Darchen Research Institute I know You know Well I guess anyway And today is the 15th of June and he won't be here to sign a quarterly statement and I'm going nuts have a cigarette will yes sir Try one of these Then Marlin I've never heard of Marlin before today What are we a bunch of guinea pigs Something wrong It's too Wrong Oh the thought Miss Horn the thought He went to his desk and stared the mail Before he opened it he knew that the factory distributors enveloped container in order for 12 new electronic computers He knew that the development journal contained an article about a new method of transprinting selective brain circuits human engineers onto the electric brain circuits of robot engineers to facilitate the operation of automatic factories He knew that there was a complaint from sons about the control chemicals newest household robot circuit After a long while he forced himself to open them They were exactly as he suspected Hello This is it Do remember Remember what Just remember All right now listen Harry let's stop playing games Yesterday either I was dreaming or you stopped me on the bus Today the same thing happens Oh you do remember thank thought so when I saw you I couldn't be sure What does it you want morning when I get off the bus you get off with me Be casual They may be watching Who may be watching Swanson Hello You bus Bearcourt Yes I'm still out of cigarettes Would you buy me a pack of kelvins Wouldn't you rather have Marlon I smoke kelvins But Mr Bearcourt Marlon has that soft creamy smoke that's so soothing to your throat Oh you really believe that stuff It's true I wouldn't say this Mr Bearcourt except that Well I've gotten to know you pretty well and I've grown to admire you so much I see What you mind Mr Bearcourt if I told you that for months now I wanted to Well comfort you I know how troubled you Well you've never mentioned your feelings before Ms Horn My name is April Oh that's pretty name You see I do have your welfare at heart That's why when I see you smoking kelvins I know Marlon's so much better won't you me buy some of them for you Well suppose so not Here bring me a cotton Oh Bearcourt Go I think you ought to go I'll be back There was something wrong Something definitely peculiar about what was happening The call from Henry Swanson The strange behavior of his secretary and horn These new products the dream Guy Burkhart went home that night feeling like a man in a nightmare Did you hear It's me have a good day Fair Oh before you sit down go down the cellar and put in a new fuse The switch in the hall closet blew out I I shut it off Okay It's up it'll be right a minute So don't start fooling around without all boat hull you've building I won't I won't Mary Mary What is it Come down here Hurry up What is it know I'm not sure I was looking for a fuse and I thought maybe I'd drop one under the boat scratched around Look let me put the flashlight on it Well What the floor What about the floor It's supposed to be cement Well well it's copper There's a thin layer of cement underneath its metal Look here Underneath the concrete more metal And here on the wall You see metal That'll under the floor behind the walls every place I don't really understand Mary I know this sounds crazy but somebody for reasons I can't even begin to guess has taken this house and replaced it with a clever imitation Guy Mary I'm going look around a little more Well your dinner will be ready All right say before me There couple of things I've got to figure out The following morning Guy Berkhard walk up screaming He dragged himself into the kitchen where his wife Mary was preparing breakfast and discovered it was still June 15th Mary where's the morning paper is it Outside the door I guess June 15th You'd better hurry dear Today's the day Mr Barfield's out the quarterly tax return Oh no it isn't Why He won't be there You'll get a meeting with crackpot the Human Research Institute Dork He'll be there And Miss Horn will have a new hairdo and the elevator will be selling some new product and Swanson What about Swanson Swanson listen I wonder if it's going to be the same today or whether Guy world are you talking about Nothing of my way my coat haven't had any breakfast I don't want to miss my bus I'll see you tonight Guy Berkhard got on his bus They were the same unfamiliar faces the same unusually new looking buildings the same unusually bright sunshine And on the customary corner Henry Swanson pale and furtive climbed aboard Excuse me sir It's quite alright Do remember the phone call Yes Thank Get off at the next corner and me Where are you going There's an excavation for about a black down Make sure you aren't followed I'll go first Berkhard here behind the fence now Henry what's this all about I'm not sure At first I thought perhaps they were Russians Now in beginning to think they're Martians No humans could have accomplished what they've accomplished Now wait a minute Start from the beginning Henry What's going on Look Berkhard peculiar things have been happening to you right Yes A lot of your friends are missing your house seems changed Something strange is not The date Today is June 15th Yet I could swear yesterday was June 15th the day before that You got it friend It's always June 15th And you and I are the only ones who know But why Henry How I'm not sure I think it's some sort of mass hypnosis or something Well why doesn't it work for us My wife Mary doesn't remember a thing Somehow when it happened they missed us We were protected from the full force of the rays or whatever they used Berkhard where were you on the night of the 14th about midnight Let me see that with Sunday night Yes Yeah I was down in the cellar under the boat unveiling I was in my dark room developing some pictures It just doesn't make any sense to me Russians Martians What makes you think that I've seen them Where At the end of the tunnel What tunnel The one they built under Tyler Town A tunnel under Tyler Town Yes that's right It's made out of copper or some alloy Copper wait a minute I found a copper layer under my cellar floor last night So did I That's how I discovered it I found a way to get into It's at the bottom of this excavation Holy mackerel Henry why don't we tell the police Because we can't trust them Even the police may be Martians in disguise Oh come on are you being melodramatic Who am I But you just come with me Where Into the tunnel I'll show you Henry Swanson led Guy small hole on the side There he removed the cutout piece of metallic substance crawled into a dimly lighted tunnel They walked for what seemed like two miles until Swanson held his finger to his lips We've got to quiet now Henry this is fantastic They better tunnel right under the whole town Oh you haven't seen anything yet There's a room a little farther down We'll be through a glass in the door Is it safe It's perfectly safe Unless one of them comes along Oh come on Okay Here Berkhardt looked through this glass Now just so I know I'm not completely insane Tell me what you see Good Lord Well a tremendous panel with dozens of tele screens And in front of each of you is robot They seem to be computing something Yes I've watched They're evaluating data from the screens Have you got chance to look at the data on those screens No I've been afraid to go in There might be a warning circuit somewhere I don't think you what those robots are working on we could go to the authorities I'll risk it if you will it's worth chance We'll lost anyway Okay Open the door So far so good Come on Let's take a look at that data But don't interfere with the robots Don't worry Yeah let's look at this screen Listen to this Tests in the 47K12 group Marlon cigarettes pulled 80 using the soft feminine approach Indications are that an extension of this approach would influence at least 70 nationwide The direct elevator pitch pulled only 10 There should be abandoned new series of high persuasion personal elements introduced And what this means Well I haven't afraid this idea I don't blame you This is crazy but it fits the facts when I think about it Do know who's behind this Martians No not Martians Henry humans What Humans were interested in developing the perfect propaganda machine What I know who they are or how they've done but somehow they've taken Tyler Town over Hypnosis Hypnosis drugs maybe some kind of a ray or something However they do it What happens is that they let us live through a single day During that day they pour all kinds of suggestions and propaganda into us At the end of the day they evaluate the results See how we've reacted midnight they wash the day out of our minds And the next morning we start the same day over again with different stimuli Do know what that means Henry Suppose one man learned how to influence people 100 By in a year he could sell us anything from freezes to political candidates Wait a minute Where pigs Henry This whole community is one big test tube for dorkens propaganda research Very we do know but somehow we've got to get out of this town get to the think we can It's worth a try Come on Wait What is it Look through the door There's somebody coming down the tunnel You've got to hide Behind the circuit box Good Lord it's Dorken The head of the Research Institute It's quiet All right very out We know you're in this room Ms has informed us that you remember I must warn you that it's useless to buck us Come out peacefully That our maintenance crew adjust you properly So you don't remember from one experiment to the next It will be quite painless You don't come out peacefully We'll have to get you Henry take this wrench When I give the word jump in But he may be armed We've got nothing to lose Very well I'm coming after you No Oh my God I've killed him No wait It is called unbuttoned He'll be as hard as still leading Henry What is it What's wrong Look underneath this coat It's a robot A humanoid robot designed to look like Dorken Come on let's get out of here Wait What's that love speaker I told you it was useless gentlemen Who are you Mr Dorken naturally The real Mr Dorken What are you trying to do to us Mealy trying to prevent you from damaging my experiment gentlemen You can't get away with this Dorken Sooner or later somebody the FBI or somebody is going to get wind of this madness Really Bercard you're quite naive Now why not be reasonable and let the maintenance crews adjust you if I refuse I suppose you'll kill me That would be quite impossible Oh You see Bercard you're already dead Dead You're shocked It's quite true You and everyone else in this town were killed by a premature atomic blast at the Control Chemical Plant The blast occurred at a m on June 15th That is the last thing imprinted on your minds That is why you wake up screaming each morning No it isn't true But it is What I and my associates did was take the brain circuits dead bodies We stored them in electrochemical batteries till we had a chance to rebuild the cities and begin our tests Do you think I believe a fantastic tale like that I imagine you find it incredible Of course we didn't rebuild everything exactly After all it only has to last for a single day June 15th At midnight we turn off the power and wash out the memory of the day Your your friends swans unfortunately have defective circuits You remember Bercard it's no use we're trapped not me Who what can we do We can make a run for down the tunnel Come on It's useless Bercard Keep going It's useless Now now the store is open Yeah it opens Oh no No I don't believe it Swanson look They were standing on of smooth finished metal At their feet ledge dropped away into chasm so deep they could not see the bottom Beyond was only a glare so bright that their eyes could not stand to look into it And yet just at the limit of their vision something towered something so huge it was almost inconceivable something Bercard yes This is Dortian How do you understand why it's useless The great looming figure moved closer It seemed to take shape now And yet it was so gigantic as to be unbelievable It came closer The glare was partially blocked And then Guy Bercard knew that the towering shape was none other than Dortian himself You see how I did it Bercard I took your brain circuits and had them reduced so they could be transferred to tiny humanoid mannequins That's what you Bercard A tiny miniature of yourself And this city this whole experiment I am conducting is built on a table top It was the morning of June 15th And Guy Bercard woke up out of a dream screaming
Ryan looked up from his boarding pass and sighed There was his new partner Natalie awkwardly climbing out of a taxi at the curb of the airport She fumbled with her duffel bag jacket and massive luggage that squeaked shrilly as she tugged it through the airport doors Ryan walked reluctantly toward her pulling his own neatly packed carry on bag behind him After checking Natalie's bag the two walked toward the airport security lines As Natalie struggled to extract her ID from the bottom of her duffel bag Ryan scoped out the different line choices Bingo Asians He motioned toward the rightmost line with his chin You can't be serious replied Natalie Ryan shrugged Look at the other lines I never get behind people traveling with infants I've never seen a stroll or collapse in less than 20 minutes Old people are worse Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on earth He motioned to the center line where three Middle Eastern men in suits were taking off their shoes Five words Randomly selected for additional screening Now Asians They pack light travel efficiently and they've got a thing for slip on shoes God love them Natalie stared at him in wide eyed shock That's racist I'm like my mother Ryan smiled back at her Isterio type It's faster Natalie followed behind him in disbelief As they passed through the metal detector Natalie's watch triggered the alarm and she was pulled aside for a pat down Ryan stood by impatiently as she was finally cleared and then motioned for her to follow him as he walked down the concourse He stopped halfway to their gate and pointed at a luggage store If you're going to be flying with me you need to get a carry on back You know how much time you lose by checking in I don't know Side Natalie Five Ten minutes Thirty five minutes of flight I travel 270 days a year That's 157 hours That makes seven days You willing to throw away an entire week Natalie perced her lips but then turned and walked into the luggage store Soon they were walking down the aisle of the plane Natalie carrying both her duffel bag and a new compact carry on that matched Ryan's Ryan helped load the carry on into the overhead compartment while she started to unpack items from her duffel bag onto the seat Ryan looked over in confusion Two neck pillows You realize that we're in business class and they will give you a neck pillow right Natalie grimaced back at him I like my own stuff Don't you like feeling connected to home Ryan laughed This is where I live All the things that you probably hate about traveling the recycled air the artificial lighting are warm reminders that I am home
Vinnie and Mona stumbled Blieriied into a dingy looking diner The place was deserted saved for a few flies lazily circling around the lamps The hostess who was loudly chewing a of gum pointed toward the counter 'There are seats at the counter if you want breakfast 'Thanks said Vinnie and they took their seats with a yawn A cook wearing a white apron emerged from the back room and slapped a single menu down in front of them before silently returning through the swinging doors Mona picked it up and Vinnie looked over her shoulder On the menu were exactly three choices Breakfast for 199 lunch for 249 or dinner for 349 Mona tilted her head back and forth in sarcastic ambivalence So breakfast You think replied Vinnie stroking his chin The cook circled back to the counter You too want something to eat Two breakfasts please He rubbed his eyes as he passed the menu to the cook Can I ask you something What's the story with this incredibly remarkably loud whistle at 30 in the morning The cook's eyes narrowed Clearly these two were from out of town It's the steam whistle over by the sawmill Tells folks it's time to get up You can hear it for miles He turned his back toward the couple to face the griddle where several strips of bacon were already sizzling Mona watched in horror as he spooned a massive scoop of lard onto the griddle and pushed it around to coat the surface Excuse me said Vinnie and the cook turned to him suspiciously Have you guys around here not heard about the ongoing cholesterol problem in the country The cook looked back and forth at both of them pushed his lips and then turned back to the griddle shaking his head in disbelief Mona picked at her nails and then looked over at Vinnie You've got one huge responsibility taken on this murder case You screw up and those boys get fried Vinnie turned to her annoyed I know So you think you know what you're doing Yeah I think I know what I'm doing She held up her hands because you didn't look like you know what you were doing today in that courtroom Why is that Vinnie shrugged Well it's a lot of procedure is all It's my first trial case I'll learn as I go The cook placed two plates in front of them covered in bacon eggs in a pile of some kind of white porridge Vinnie poked at it with his fork What's this over here The cook looked at him in disbelief You've never heard of grits Sure sure I've heard of grits I've just never actually seen a grit before Go ahead honey Aren't you going to try it You first she said with a smile
